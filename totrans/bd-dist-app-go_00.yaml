- en: Gin is a high-performance HTTP web framework used to build web applications
    and microservices in Go. This book is designed to teach you the ins and outs of
    the Gin framework with the help of practical examples.

- en: You'll start by exploring the basics of the Gin framework, before progressing
    to build a real-world RESTful API. Along the way, you'll learn how to write custom
    middleware and understand the routing mechanism, as well as how to bind user data
    and validate incoming HTTP requests. The book also demonstrates how to store and
    retrieve data at scale with a NoSQL database such as MongoDB, and how to implement
    a caching layer with Redis. Next, you'll understand how to secure and test your
    API endpoints with authentication protocols such as OAuth 2 and JWT. Later chapters
    will guide you through rendering HTML templates on the server side and building
    a frontend application with the React web framework to consume API responses.
    Moreover, you'll deploy your application on **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**)
    and scale it on Kubernetes. Finally, you'll learn how to automate the deployment
    process with a CI/CD pipeline and how to troubleshoot and debug a Gin application
    in production with Prometheus and the ELK stack.
