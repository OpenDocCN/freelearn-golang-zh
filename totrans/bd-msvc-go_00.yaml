- en: Microservice architecture is sweeping the world as the de facto pattern for
    building web-based applications. Golang is a language particularly well suited
    to building them. Its strong community, encouragement of idiomatic style, and
    statically-linked binary artifacts make integrating it with other technologies
    and managing microservices at scale consistent and intuitive. This book will teach
    you the common patterns and practices, and show you how to apply these using the
    Go programming language.

    communication, and introduce you to the patterns that provide manageable code
    that is supportable in development and at scale in production. We will provide
    you with examples of how to put these concepts and patterns into practice with
    Go.

    this book will explain and illustrate with practical examples how teams of all
    sizes can start solving problems with microservices. It will help you understand
    Docker and Docker Compose, and how they can be used to isolate microservice dependencies
    and build environments. We will conclude by showing you various techniques to
    monitor, test, and secure your microservices.

    looks at what makes the Go language suitable for building microservices and takes
    a look at the standard library that has all the components required to build a
    basic microservice. Looking at the standard elements first will give you a grounding
    and make you appreciate how some of the frameworks that we will discuss later
    can be incredibly useful.'

    API*, looks at what makes a good API. We will introduce both REST and RPC, explaining
    the differences between them. We will also examine the best practices for writing
    and versioning APIs.'

    use Docker and Docker Compose as part of your development workflow. We will see
    how it is possible to build a small lightweight image for your application and
    some good practices for using Docker and writing Dockerfiles.'

    We will look at unit testing, behavioral testing, and performance testing, providing
    you with practical advice and knowledge of the core testing frameworks.'

    We will take an in-depth look at load balancing, circuit breaking, service discovery,
    and the autopilot pattern to see what a Go-specific implementation for this would
    look like.'

    successful diagnostics and debugging. We will look at using StatsD for simple
    metrics and timings, how to handle log file information, and approaches to logging
    more detailed data and platforms such as NewRelic, which provides a holistic overview
    of your service.'

    will look at JWT and how you can implement middleware for validating your requests
    and keeping things secure. We will also look at the bigger picture, looking at
    why you should implement TLS encryption and a principle of no trust between your
    services.'

    Events; you will learn about two of the most common eventing patterns and see
    how you can implement them in Go. We will also look at the introduction of Domain-Driven
    Design and how the use of a ubiquitous language can help your software development
