- en: Microservice architecture is sweeping the world as the de facto pattern for
    building web-based applications. Golang is a language particularly well suited
    to building them. Its strong community, encouragement of idiomatic style, and
    statically-linked binary artifacts make integrating it with other technologies
    and managing microservices at scale consistent and intuitive. This book will teach
    you the common patterns and practices, and show you how to apply these using the
    Go programming language.

- en: It will teach you the fundamental concepts of architectural design and RESTful
    communication, and introduce you to the patterns that provide manageable code
    that is supportable in development and at scale in production. We will provide
    you with examples of how to put these concepts and patterns into practice with
    Go.

    this book will explain and illustrate with practical examples how teams of all
    sizes can start solving problems with microservices. It will help you understand
    Docker and Docker Compose, and how they can be used to isolate microservice dependencies
    and build environments. We will conclude by showing you various techniques to
    monitor, test, and secure your microservices.

    and the advantages of the Go stack.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ba3a8742-94e7-4e47-8a47-1324a277a7f9.xhtml), *Introduction to Microservices*,
    looks at what makes the Go language suitable for building microservices and takes
    a look at the standard library that has all the components required to build a
    basic microservice. Looking at the standard elements first will give you a grounding
    and make you appreciate how some of the frameworks that we will discuss later
    can be incredibly useful.'

    API*, looks at what makes a good API. We will introduce both REST and RPC, explaining
    the differences between them. We will also examine the best practices for writing
    and versioning APIs.'

    explains how you can wrap your application into a Docker image and how you can
    use Docker and Docker Compose as part of your development workflow. We will see
    how it is possible to build a small lightweight image for your application and
    some good practices for using Docker and writing Dockerfiles.'

    the various techniques to ensure that your microservices are of the highest quality.
    We will look at unit testing, behavioral testing, and performance testing, providing
    you with practical advice and knowledge of the core testing frameworks.'

    introduces some of the standard patterns often employed in microservice architecture.
    We will take an in-depth look at load balancing, circuit breaking, service discovery,
    and the autopilot pattern to see what a Go-specific implementation for this would
    look like.'

    We will compare and contrast these through examples of their usage.'

    examines essential techniques to ensure that your service is behaving correctly,
    and when it does not, ensures you have all the information at your disposal for
    successful diagnostics and debugging. We will look at using StatsD for simple
    metrics and timings, how to handle log file information, and approaches to logging
    more detailed data and platforms such as NewRelic, which provides a holistic overview
    of your service.'

    a look at authentication, authorization, and security for your microservice. We
    will look at JWT and how you can implement middleware for validating your requests
    and keeping things secure. We will also look at the bigger picture, looking at
    why you should implement TLS encryption and a principle of no trust between your
    services.'

    discusses that a common pattern to allow your microservices to collaborate using
    Events; you will learn about two of the most common eventing patterns and see
    how you can implement them in Go. We will also look at the introduction of Domain-Driven
    Design and how the use of a ubiquitous language can help your software development
    process.'

    a continuous delivery setup for one of the simple applications we created earlier
    in the book.'
