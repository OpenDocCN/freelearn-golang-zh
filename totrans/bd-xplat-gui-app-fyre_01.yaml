- en: Since their invention nearly 50 years ago, **graphical user interfaces** (**GUIs**)
    have been the standard way to interact with a software product. In this time they
    have evolved, and traditional graphical applications are being challenged by the
    ubiquity of web-based software and new interaction methods for smartphones and
    handheld computers. Despite these new trends, there are still many reasons why
    building a native graphical application could be the right strategy for your productâ€”especially
    if it could be deployed to all the platforms available.

- en: In this section, we will see how GUIs and the graphical toolkits used to program
    them have evolved. We will explore the pros and cons of the technologies over
    the years and how some can be used for cross-platform development. We will learn
    about the Fyne project, its background and vision, and how it aims to be an ideal
    solution to the evolving needs of GUI development.
