- en: The Fyne toolkit has many packages of components that build on each other. Providing
    a full cross-platform widget toolkit requires many enabling areas, including graphics
    **application programming interfaces** (**APIs**), file handling, and layout management.
    In addition to this, Fyne provides advanced functionality such as data binding
    and storage abstractions that enable complex applications and workflows to be
    built with ease.

- en: To understand the full capabilities of Fyne we will explore all the areas of
    the toolkit, its packages, and its functionality. Each of the chapters in this
    section includes an example application that explores the concepts, with detailed
    steps and full source code.
