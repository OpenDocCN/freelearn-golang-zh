    *Widget Library and Themes*, we saw how information can be gathered and presented.
    Each widget we looked at was configured manually, and accessing data that the
    user entered (such as with the `Entry` widget) required code to query the widget's
    state. The `fyne.io/fyne/data/binding` package provides functionality that supports
    automatically connecting widgets to data sources to handle this more efficiently.

    useful, and how it is designed within the Fyne APIs.

- en: There are many different approaches to data binding, and definitions can vary,
    depending on the toolkit that you are working with. In general, data binding allows
    the component of a graphical interface to have its display controlled by a separate
    data source. Moreover, it ensures that the graphical representation is always
    up to date with changes, and that user actioned changes within the user interface
    are synchronized back to the original data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Android also provides similar functionality, which is documented at [https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite the various approaches taken by each toolkit, the basics of any successful
    data binding are that the graphical output is automatically updated based on the
    state of a separate data object. This is known as **unidirectional** binding,
    often known as a *one-way data flow*. This is sufficient for data display when
    the information comes from an external source. However, it is not sufficient if
    your application will be modifying the data. Complete data binding (**two-way**
    or **bidirectional**) ensures that as well as keeping presented data up to date,
    it will also update the source data if the user alters the presentation through
    some interactive widget.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All the data binding that's done in the Fyne toolkit is bidirectional, meaning
    that each connection that's made can read or write the data it is connected to.
    Widgets that are only used for display purposes will not make use of the ability
    to write the data, but an input widget such as an entry or a slider will push
    data changes out to connected bindings. There's an underlying data source for
    each data binding. We will look at what data types are supported in the next section.

    the contents in one of Go's primitive data types. For a `Float` binding, this
    will be `float64`. If an error occurred when you accessed this value, then an
    error will be returned in the second parameter. Though unlikely at this stage,

    passing the new value (as with the `Get()` return value, this is a primitive data
    type). As a result of the value changing (if the new value is different to the
    current state), the data binding will notify all the code that is registered with
    it. If an error occurred when you were setting the value, the binding notifications
    will not be triggered, and the error will be returned.

    possible to bind the same value to different widgets since both `Slider` and `ProgressBar`
    expect a `Float` value for their data. However, it is not always the case that
    these data types will align perfectly. Sometimes, we will need to perform conversions

    package. Like all binding conversion functions, this takes a single parameter,

    string, which is similar to `fmt.Printf` in terms of usage. If we want to specify

    supply the parsed information to your widget. However, with data binding, we want
    to keep a direct connection to the source data, which means conversion needs to
    happen within the chain of data binding.

    two-way data bindings. This means that we do not need to add any further code
    to propagate changes in the data. If an `IntToString` connection is made, then
    changes to the source `Int` will not only result in new values in the output `String`,
    but calling `Set()` on our `String` will cause a parsed integer to be pushed back
    to the original `Int` binding. This will depend on the string being correctly
    formatted, of course – setting an invalid value will not propagate a change it
    will return an error instead.

    a `widget.RadioGroup`, or if you are modeling your data with bindings that will
    be passed to your own widgets, the concept of a data list will be important. The
    data binding API defines `DataList` as a binding that provides additional `Length`
    and `GetItem(int)` functions, as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE17]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: This generic definition means that a list can encapsulate a data type – the
    `DataItem` instance returned by `GetItem()` could be a `String`, `Int`, or even
    another `DataList`. You can implement a `DataList` using the previous interface
    or you can use one of the type-based lists provided by Fyne. The `Length` method
    will always return the number of items in this list, while `GetItem` can be used
    to access the data binding at the specified index (as lists are ordered).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Changes in the list's length (through `append`, `insert`, or `remove`) will
    trigger a callback on any listeners that are registered on the `DataList`. If
    the value of one of the items changes, it will trigger the change listener on
    the individual item rather than the containing list. Because of this, we can be
    clever about minimizing the impact of UI changes when a listener calls our code.
    We'll see how this process works in the following sections when we use a `StringList`
    to manage many items presented in a `List` widget.

    You can build a new list with no content using the `New...List` methods, or you

    add rows that match the length of the data. It will grow or shrink when the length

    binding in the `List` widget. The first parameter, `DataList`, replaces the `Length`
    function, which is used in a regular `List` constructor. The second parameter,
    the function that sets up template items, remains the same. The callback in the
    last parameter for updating items is similar to a regular list, except the first
    parameter is now a `DataItem` instead of a `ListItemID`. We can keep the `Text`
    value of `Label` up to date by calling `Bind()` and passing the `DataItem` once
    it has been cast to the `binding.String` strong type. Applying a binding in this
    manner will implement the standard API, so we don't have to worry about how caching
    will impact this functionality.

    when casting `DataItem` to the correct binding type on each access. Doing this

    keys to identify child elements instead of an `int` ID. Instead of the `Length()`
    method, which returns how long the list is, it requires a `Keys()` function, which
    returns a string slice containing all of the keys present in the dataset. To find

    the value of one of the items changes, it will trigger the change listener on
    the individual item rather than all of the DataMap listeners (as with items in
    a list, as mentioned in the previous section). Because maps normally have many
    different types of data in them, creating one using the standard API is a little
    different to creating a list, as we will see now. Of course, any type that implements
    the `DataMap` interface can be used in map data binding, but it is normally easier
    to use the provided implementations.

    type signature. First, let''s look at creating a new map; the following code creates

    by using a `struct` type. In this situation, there are a set of fields where a
    name maps to a value (as we've seen many times in this book already). As you can
    see, this definition matches nicely to the maps that we saw in the previous section.
    To save a lot of manual code, the data binding API provides a simple way to automatically
    create a `DataMap` from an existing struct variable.

    variables of the struct. To be able to bind a field in a `struct`, it must be
    an exported field (the name must start with an uppercase letter). The following

    such as user configuration options, current input field contents, and a history
    of opened files. Using files to store this information would require additional
    code to format the information for storage; using a database would require additional
    servers or dependencies for an application. To help with this, Fyne provides a
    **Preferences** API, similar to those used by iOS and Android developers.
  prefs: []

    using a specific string identifier, known as a **key**. Each **value** that is

    or type checking. Any time that this data changes, it will be saved for future
    use.

    not have access to the `App` instance that loaded the application, you can use
    `fyne.CurrentApp().Preferences()` instead, which will return the same reference.
    There is an additional requirement, however – each application must declare a
    unique identifier for use in storage. To do this, we must change the `app.New()`
    constructor function to `app.NewWithID()`, passing a suitable unique identifier.
    Typically, the unique ID will be in reverse DNS format, and must match the identifier
    you will use during distribution (see [*Chapter 9*](B16820_09_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219),

- en: In this chapter, we have looked at the various APIs available within Fyne for
    managing and storing data. We explored the concept of data binding and saw how
    it can help keep a user interface up to date, while at the same time reduce the
    amount of code we need to write.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then looked at the Preferences API, which allows us to persist user data
    between application launches. When combined with the data binding code, this came
    with no additional complexity. By utilizing these features, we implemented an
    example application that manages data for tracking water consumption and stored
    it on our local device, ready to use the next day.

- en: With that, we have covered the most common standard widgets and functionality
    in the Fyne toolkit. Sometimes, an application may require widgets or features
    that are not included. To support this, the toolkit allows us to extend the built-in
    components. We will explore this in the next chapter.
