			<p>Having explored the toolkit and built our first applications using Fyne, we see how easy it can be to build applications that work across multiple platforms. Now, it is time to look at how to manage our applications and prepare them for publication. As each distribution system has different requirements for metadata and packaging formats, this can be daunting, but the following section will walk you through the details. By the end of these chapters you will have packaged up your apps, installed them like native applications on your desktop and phone, and uploaded them to various app stores.</p>
			<p>This section will cover the following topics:</p>

				<li><a href="B16820_09_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bundling Resources and Preparing for Release</em></li>

			<p>We start this section by reviewing how to organize our applications, and then move on to packaging and distribution.</p>
