    see how easy it can be to build applications that work across multiple platforms.
    Now, it is time to look at how to manage our applications and prepare them for
    publication. As each distribution system has different requirements for metadata
    and packaging formats, this can be daunting, but the following section will walk
    you through the details. By the end of these chapters you will have packaged up
    your apps, installed them like native applications on your desktop and phone,
    and uploaded them to various app stores.
