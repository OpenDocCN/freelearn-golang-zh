			<h1 id="_idParaDest-237"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Chapter 10</em>: Distribution – App Stores and Beyond</h1>
			<p>The final challenge in cross-platform development is how to deliver your app to distribute your completed project. Whether you want to distribute using platform-specific app stores, package managers, or through a simple download site, there is a little more work to do. This chapter explores the steps required to deliver applications to system app stores, mobile marketplaces, and download sites.</p>
			<p>This chapter will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Building your application for release</li>
				<li>Distributing apps to desktop app stores</li>
				<li>Uploading apps to Google Play and iOS App Store</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you should have the knowledge to distribute your apps to any platform.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>This chapter has the same requirements as <a href="B16820_03_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor066"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Window, Canvas, and Drawing</em>, that is, to have the <strong class="bold">Fyne</strong> toolkit installed and a <strong class="bold">Go</strong> and <strong class="bold">C</strong> compiler working. For more information, please refer to that chapter.</p>
			<p>For deployment to <strong class="bold">Android</strong> devices, you will need to install the <strong class="bold">Android SDK</strong> and <strong class="bold">NDK</strong> (see <a href="B16820_12_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256"><em class="italic">Appendix B</em></a>, <em class="italic">Installation of Mobile Build Tools</em>). To build for <strong class="bold">iOS</strong> devices, you will also need to install <strong class="bold">Xcode</strong> on your <strong class="bold">Macintosh</strong> computer (an Apple Mac is required for licensing reasons).</p>
			<p>The full source code for this chapter can be found at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Cross-Platform-GUI-Applications-with-Fyne/tree/master/Chapter10">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Cross-Platform-GUI-Applications-with-Fyne/tree/master/Chapter10</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-239"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>Building your application for release</h1>
			<p>As <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>we saw<a id="_idIndexMarker592"/> in <a href="B16820_09_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bundling Resources and Preparing for Release</em>, the <strong class="source-inline">fyne package</strong> command bundles our application binary and metadata into a format that can be installed on <strong class="bold">operating systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSes</strong>) just like any native graphical application. However, in addition to differing formats for each platform, there are additional considerations when looking to distribute software, such as certification and app store upload file formats. To handle this, there is another sub-command within the build tool, <strong class="source-inline">fyne release</strong>.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will learn how to use the <strong class="source-inline">release</strong> command to prepare an application for sharing.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-240"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Running the release command</h2>
			<p>Just<a id="_idIndexMarker593"/> like the <strong class="source-inline">fyne</strong> <strong class="source-inline">package</strong> command that we saw in <a href="B16820_09_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bundling Resources and Preparing for Release</em>, this new <strong class="source-inline">release</strong> command is responsible for packaging up our application with its metadata. The <strong class="source-inline">release</strong> command, however, applies changes to the application in preparation for distribution. The specific changes will differ depending on the OS, but usually include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Turning off any debug output</li>
				<li>Instructing applications to use <em class="italic">production</em> identities for web services</li>
				<li>Packaging applications into distribution-specific archives</li>
				<li>Applying the certification required for app stores</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As we work through this chapter, we will look at options that are specific to each platform, but in this section, we can explore how to adapt applications for release builds for any OS.</p>
			<p>Let's imagine that we have a function in our app called <strong class="source-inline">connectToServer()</strong> that will initiate a web connection to one of our company's services. Throughout the development process, it has been connecting to a development server, but for our distributed app we want to use the <strong class="bold">production</strong> (sometimes called <em class="italic">live</em>) server.</p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/>steps demonstrate how we can use this type of build to adapt the code appropriately for release:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To build this demo, we create a new <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file that defines two different possible server authentication keys, <strong class="source-inline">serverKeyDevelopment</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">serverKeyProduction</strong>:<p class="source-code">const (</p><p class="source-code">    serverKeyDevelopment = "DEVELOPMENT_KEY"</p><p class="source-code">    serverKeyProduction  = "PRODUCTION_KEY"</p><p class="source-code">)</p></li>
				<li>Next, we add a simple function that opens a dialog window showing the authentication key that will be used:<p class="source-code">func connectToServer(a fyne.App, w fyne.Window) {</p><p class="source-code">    key := serverKeyDevelopment</p><p class="source-code">    if a.Settings().BuildType() == fyne.BuildRelease {</p><p class="source-code">        key = serverKeyProduction</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p class="source-code">    dialog.ShowInformation("Connect to server",</p><p class="source-code">        "Using key: "+key, w)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>As you can see, this function takes the current <strong class="source-inline">fyne.App</strong> as one parameter, so that we can query the build type using the <strong class="source-inline">BuildType()</strong> function. The second is the current <strong class="source-inline">fyne.Window</strong> parameter, which we use so that we can show the dialog for this example. Such a function would normally return a server connection, but this is just a simple demo.</p></li>
				<li>Just like previous examples, we also need to create a basic <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function that will run the example. In this case, we open a new window that says simply <strong class="bold">Connecting...</strong>, and then we launch the <strong class="source-inline">connectToServer</strong> method that will demonstrate the build type:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    a := app.New()</p><p class="source-code">    w := a.NewWindow("Server key demo")</p><p class="source-code">    w.SetContent(widget.NewLabel("Connecting..."))</p><p class="source-code">    w.Resize(fyne.NewSize(300, 160))</p><p class="source-code">    connectToServer(a, w)</p><p class="source-code">    w.ShowAndRun()</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Now we <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>simply run the application:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">$ go run</strong> .</p><p>You should see that it creates a window, shown in the following screenshot:</p><div id="_idContainer116" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_10.1_B16820.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1 – Running in development mode&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.1 – Running in development mode</p></li>
				<li>Next, let's build the application for release. As we are packaging the app metadata at this point, we will need an icon file. An example, <strong class="source-inline">Icon.png</strong>, is included in the book repository, but you can add any you like, placing it alongside <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong>. We can then prepare the release version using the <strong class="source-inline">fyne</strong> tool:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">$ fyne release</strong></p></li>
				<li>Running the packaged application by double-clicking the application, you should see this different output:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer117" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.2_B16820.jpg" alt="Figure 10.2 – Running in release mode&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.2 – Running in release mode</p>
			<p>The preceding example is a simple introduction to the <strong class="source-inline">release</strong> command and how it can adjust application behavior. As we use it throughout this chapter, you will see additional parameters required by various systems for certification and other features. We could have added information here about the version and build number (using <strong class="source-inline">-appVersion</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">-appBuild</strong>), but for most desktop releases this is optional. We will start adding it to the commands later in this chapter.</p>
			<p>With the application<a id="_idIndexMarker596"/> now bundled in this section, we could distribute the application to <em class="italic">beta testers</em> or small communities who are happy to manage their own software installation by downloading from the web.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-241"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Sharing your app on the web</h2>
			<p>With an application<a id="_idIndexMarker597"/> now set up to use the production values <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>where appropriate, we can start a plan for distribution. In many cases, the files created by <strong class="source-inline">fyne release</strong> will be in a different format to <strong class="source-inline">fyne package</strong> (because this command focuses on app store and marketplace distribution). To apply the release parameters to the previous package format, you can use <strong class="source-inline">fyne package –release</strong> instead.</p>
			<p>If you want to share your applications without using the platform's official distribution, then this can be done by uploading the result of the <strong class="source-inline">release</strong> command to a website or file sharing platform. In most cases, this is a simple case of copying the file or uploading it to wherever you want to share it. However, with some systems (mainly macOS), the application is a bundle, or directory, and this may not be downloadable from a website link. In these situations, it is a good idea to compress or archive the set of files into a single file that can be downloaded.</p>
			<p>On your mac (where macOS apps are normally created) you can open the app folder in <strong class="bold">Finder</strong> and right-click the package, and then select the <strong class="bold">Compress &lt;filename&gt;</strong> option from the context menu, shown as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer118" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_10.3_B16820.jpg" alt="Figure 10.3 – Compressing a macOS app bundle for sharing on the web&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.3 – Compressing a macOS app bundle for sharing on the web</p>
			<p>The resulting <strong class="source-inline">.zip</strong> file<a id="_idIndexMarker599"/> created can be shared more easily from a website, and<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> people downloading it can just double-click the file to expand your application, which can then be run as normal.</p>
			<p>In this section, we saw how to package an application for release and how to share the resulting file so that others can install our software. However, for most applications, it will be more beneficial to distribute through the provided store or marketplace. We'll step through this process for the most common OSes in the following sections.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-242"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>Distributing apps to desktop app stores</h1>
			<p>Most <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>desktop OSes now have a central location<a id="_idIndexMarker602"/> for discovering and installing applications. Apple<a id="_idIndexMarker603"/> created the <strong class="bold">Mac App Store</strong>, Windows has<a id="_idIndexMarker604"/> the <strong class="bold">Microsoft Store</strong>, and each Linux distribution has its preferred package manager. Having an application listed in (and hosted by) a platform marketplace significantly increases the number of users you can expect and also reduces the associated hosting costs. When paired with carefully prepared metadata (as described in <a href="B16820_09_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bundling Resources and Preparing for Release</em>), a marketplace can easily become your largest distribution channel.</p>
			<p>In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker605"/> step through the process for the <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>macOS and Windows stores. We will return to Linux and BSD distribution later in the chapter as they are less mainstream and far more complicated.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-243"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Mac App Store</h2>
			<p>The Mac App Store <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>is the desktop version of Apple's famous iOS App Store. It provides many thousands of applications available to buy and download, or gift to others. There is also curated content, which includes listings of the most popular apps in various categories, as well as staff picks and recommended software. Unfortunately, the Mac App Store cannot be browsed online as it requires the App Store software, which is pre-installed on compatible Mac computers.</p>
			<p>To distribute an app on the App Store, you will need to have the development tools installed (see <a href="B16820_12_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256"><em class="italic">Appendix B</em></a>, <em class="italic">Installation of Mobile Build Tools</em>), but you will also need to sign<a id="_idIndexMarker608"/> up to the <strong class="bold">Apple Developer Program</strong>. If you are not already a member, you can sign up at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/">developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/</a>. The development resources are free to access, but there is an annual subscription charge for access to the code signing tools, which are required to complete the release process we are about to explore.</p>
			<h3>Packaging a macOS release</h3>
			<p>To package a release for <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>upload to the Mac App Store is like the release process we explored earlier in this chapter, but we must also provide certification details that apply <strong class="bold">code signing</strong> to our <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>application.</p>
			<p>Code signing is a complicated process to set up, so for the purpose of this description, it is assumed that you already have a distribution certificate installed. For further instructions on downloading your certificate, please see Apple's documentation at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/support/certificates/">developer.apple.com/support/certificates/</a>. You need to note the name of the certificate (use <strong class="bold">Keychain Access</strong> to find your <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>developer certificates) for use in the <strong class="source-inline">build</strong> command later. You will also need to note which provisioning profile you are using to build. As with certificates, this should already be downloaded and installed on your computer, but you need to note the name (you can find more details on the Apple Developer portal at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/">developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/</a>).</p>
			<p>Once you have identified the certificate name and provisioning profile, you can use the details in the following command:</p>
			<p class="source-code">$ fyne release -appVersion 1.0 -appBuild 1 -certificate "CertificateName" -profile "ProfileName"</p>
			<p>The resulting app <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>package is ready to be uploaded to the <strong class="bold">App Store Connect</strong> website for validation.</p>
			<h3>Uploading to the Mac App Store</h3>
			<p>App Store applications are managed<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> through the App Store Connect website  (at <a href="http://appstoreconnect.apple.com/">appstoreconnect.apple.com/</a>). Log in using your Apple Developer account and create a new application (if you have not already done so). This is where you add the metadata that will be displayed in the store – be sure to check the information carefully as some data cannot be changed after release.</p>
			<p>Well-chosen descriptions and screenshots will help your application to be more easily discovered. Within this app definition, you need to start preparing a new release, with an appropriate version number and supporting information. You will probably notice that you are not yet able to select a build – to enable this, we first need to upload the compiled package.</p>
			<p>Apple has recently created a new app <a id="_idIndexMarker614"/>named <strong class="bold">Transporter</strong> that is currently the easiest way to upload a new build. You can follow these steps to do so:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the Transporter app and log in with your <strong class="bold">Apple ID</strong>.</li>
				<li>Once logged in, you will be asked to choose the application to upload – select the application package created by the <strong class="source-inline">release</strong> command in the previous section and proceed to the upload.</li>
				<li>Once complete, the build will appear on the App Store Connect website (you may need to refresh the page). If you prefer command-line tools for managing the upload progress, you<a id="_idIndexMarker615"/> can use <strong class="bold">xcrun altool</strong>, which provides the same capability. Whichever way you upload the package, you need to select the resulting build in the app details on the website.</li>
				<li>Once you have chosen this new build, you can click on the <strong class="bold">Submit for Review</strong> button to start<a id="_idIndexMarker616"/> the review process.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We'll now move to the next section to learn about the review process.</p>
			<h3>Mac App Store review process</h3>
			<p>As soon as an app is<a id="_idIndexMarker617"/> submitted for review, it goes through an automated set of code checks. This process verifies that the application does not contain obvious errors in metadata or code signing, and performs a code analysis to ensure you are not using APIs that are private to Apple or otherwise restricted. Assuming that these automated checks pass, then the application will be sent for final acceptance by a member of the App Store review team.</p>
			<p>The review team checks your application for quality, reliability, compliance with the <strong class="bold">Human Interface Guidelines</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIG</strong>: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/">developer.apple.com/app-store/review/</a>), and that it meets other criteria for<a id="_idIndexMarker618"/> inclusion on the store. This process typically takes a day or two, but can be longer for the first release of a new application. Once the process is complete, your software will be available to purchase or download on the App Store. In your first week of distribution, it may even be included in the <strong class="bold">New and Noteworthy </strong>section.</p>
			<p>Now that we have understood the Mac App Store process, let's look at the Microsoft Store process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>Microsoft Store</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Microsoft Store</strong> is the<a id="_idIndexMarker619"/> official location for finding and installing software, apps, and games for all the current <strong class="bold">Windows</strong>, <strong class="bold">Windows Phone</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Xbox</strong> devices. It provides hosting and search facilities as well as handling payments for paid software and supports discounts and vouchers as well. You can browse the contents of the Microsoft Store online (at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/store/apps">www.microsoft.com/store/apps</a>) or by using the Store apps on each of the systems it supports. </p>
			<p>To submit an application to the Microsoft Store, you will require a Microsoft account (which you may already have if you've signed in to Windows, Xbox, or <strong class="bold">Office 365</strong>). You will also have to start an annual subscription to access the relevant portions of the partner portal. You can log in and sign up at <a href="http://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/dashboard/apps/signup">partner.microsoft.com/en-US/dashboard/apps/signup</a>.</p>
			<h3>Packaging a Windows release</h3>
			<p>Preparing a release<a id="_idIndexMarker620"/> package for the Microsoft Store is very similar to the packaging we have done before, but as a release asset, it will require version numbers applied. As with the macOS App Store, we will need to sign the software. If you have not already done so, be sure to download your certificate, noting its name. Windows apps use a combined version number, such as <strong class="source-inline">1.2.3.4</strong>, but the <strong class="source-inline">fyne</strong> tool splits this into two parts. To package the app for a specific version, pass the last number as <strong class="source-inline">-appBuild</strong> and the rest of the version as <strong class="source-inline">-appVersion</strong>, shown as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">$ fyne release -appVersion 1.2.3 -appBuild 4 –certificate "CertificateName" -password "MyPassword"</strong></p>
			<p>The output of this command will be a <strong class="source-inline">.appx</strong> file. This file is the package type required for uploading to the store and should not be shared in other ways.</p>
			<h3>Uploading to Microsoft Store</h3>
			<p>The completed <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>package should be uploaded to the partner portal within the <strong class="bold">Packages</strong> page. When preparing for upload, make sure that all of your application metadata has been added to the correct locations so that people will find your software easily. Once the package is uploaded, it will be checked for various errors that could stop it from being released. Should you encounter any warnings, you will need to remove the uploaded build from the portal, fix the issue, and upload a new package for retesting. </p>
			<h3>Microsoft Store review process</h3>
			<p>Once your package is<a id="_idIndexMarker622"/> uploaded and has passed the initial validation, it will be added to a queue to be reviewed. The Microsoft staff will review your application for correctness and suitability, and validate that it is of suitably high quality for inclusion in the store. Assuming that these checks all pass, they will publish it for distribution across the devices that you specified during the submission process.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will learn about Linux and BSD distributions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/>Linux and BSD distributions</h2>
			<p>Linux and BSD distributions have<a id="_idIndexMarker623"/> a reputation for handling package distribution well; a desktop system will likely have a graphical package management application that provides easily searchable indexes containing thousands of packages. Despite there being hundreds of different Linux and BSD distributions, they are all based on similar binary files and file structures.</p>
			<h3>Packaging for Linu<a id="_idTextAnchor248"/>x/Unix</h3>
			<p>The basis of packaging <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>Fyne apps for Linux and BSD systems is the <strong class="source-inline">.tar.gz</strong> file created in the <em class="italic">Building for release</em> section at the beginning of this chapter. The contents of that file will be adapted during packaging for a target distribution. By adding platform-specific metadata and running the file's package command, you can create packages for your preferred distribution.</p>
			<h3>Review process for Linux packages</h3>
			<p>Once packages have been <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>created for a system, the application developer can submit it to the package list. For each system, the method of requesting addition is different, but can normally be found in the project documentation. However, as Linux and BSD are open source systems, you may find that an existing package maintainer may be happy to do that for you.</p>
			<p>In this section, we saw how Linux and BSD packaging can be accomplished using the available tools. This, combined with the <em class="italic">Mac App Store</em> and <em class="italic">Microsoft Store</em> sections, cover how to distribute your apps on most of the major desktop OSes. Next, we will see how to adapt this approach for uploading mobile applications to the appropriate distribution channels.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>Uploading apps to Google Play and the iOS App Store</h1>
			<p>Managing releases for mobile platforms can be slightly more complicated as the apps cannot be directly tested on the devices that we use to build them. However, the Fyne release process is designed to encompass all platforms, so in this section, we will see how the same tools can be used for releasing to mobile device stores.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>iOS App Store</h2>
			<p>Packaging <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>applications for iOS is very similar to the <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>macOS distribution process described earlier in this chapter. You will need to have <strong class="bold">Xcode</strong> installed and a distribution certificate and provisioning profile prepared and downloaded from the Apple Developer portal, at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/">developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/</a>.</p>
			<h3>Packaging an iOS release</h3>
			<p>For an iOS <strong class="source-inline">release</strong> package <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>command, we run the following command on our Mac system, remembering to add the <strong class="source-inline">-os ios</strong> parameters:</p>
			<p class="source-code">$ fyne release -os ios -appVersion 1.0 -appBuild 1 -certificate "CertificateName" -profile "ProfileName"</p>
			<p>The file resulting from the preceding command will be a <strong class="source-inline">.ipa</strong> file, which is the format required for uploading an iOS app to the App Store. Once you have this file, it can be uploaded using the same process described in the <em class="italic">Mac App Store</em> section earlier in this chapter.</p>
			<h3>iOS App Store reviewing process</h3>
			<p>The review process<a id="_idIndexMarker629"/> for iOS apps is very similar to the Mac App Store. Submission of a build will start an automated check process that usually takes just minutes. After this, a manual review will be performed that can last for days, but even for reviews of complex apps in busy periods, the review will normally be completed within a week.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will look at the Google Play Store process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-248"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>Google Play Store</h2>
			<p>Packaging an Android app for the <a id="_idIndexMarker630"/>Google Play Store requires that we apply versioning information and our certification to the package file. Once again, the <strong class="source-inline">fyne release</strong> command will handle this, but we need to gather the relevant information. Version information can be passed the same as for previous builds, but the certification is different for Android.</p>
			<h3>Packaging an Android release</h3>
			<p>Certification information for<a id="_idIndexMarker631"/> Android apps is stored in a <strong class="source-inline">.keystore</strong> file. If you have distributed an Android app before, you will probably already have one. If this is your first time, you will need to set up your developer credentials, including a private key and certificate. More information is available in the official documentation at <a href="http://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing">developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing</a>. Be sure to keep your <strong class="bold">keystore</strong> safe as it will be required to release future versions of your app.</p>
			<p>Once you have located the keystore that contains this information, you are ready to start the release process. Using the same version information as other builds, we will run the <strong class="source-inline">fyne release</strong> command with an additional <strong class="source-inline">-keyStore</strong> parameter that is followed by the path to the file. The full command will look something like the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">$ fyne release -os android -appVersion 1.0 -appBuild 1 -keyStore "path/to/file.keystore"</strong></p>
			<p>Be sure to have the password and optional key alias at hand as the command will ask for additional information to complete the signing process. The result of this will be a <strong class="source-inline">.apk</strong> file much like from previous development packaging, but with signing details ready for upload. You might consider renaming the file to mark it as a release so there is no confusion later when you start with the development again.</p>
			<h3>Uploading to Play Console</h3>
			<p>To upload your application for<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> inclusion in the Google Play Store, you will need to log in to the <strong class="bold">Play Console</strong> (there will be a small charge if you have not already signed up) at <a href="http://play.google.com/console/">play.google.com/console/</a>. Once logged in, you can start the process of creating a new application. Here you will upload the metadata, icons, and other marketing materials, as with the Apple iOS App Store explored earlier.</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Production Releases</strong> section of the Play Console, you can start to define a new release for this app. Be sure to use the same version number as in the <strong class="source-inline">release</strong> command so that the file matches the metadata online. Once you have filled in the information, locate the <strong class="bold">App Bundles and APKs</strong> panel where you can drag the <strong class="source-inline">.apk</strong> file (or tap on the <strong class="bold">Upload</strong> button to choose it). Once the upload has completed, it will go through some automated checks to<a id="_idIndexMarker633"/> confirm compatibility. If anything is wrong at this stage, you can go back to your project to make the changes, re-build the file in release mode, and upload a replacement file.</p>
			<h3>Play store reviewing process</h3>
			<p>Once your app has been submitted to the Google<a id="_idIndexMarker634"/> Play Console, you can track its progress through the review process. There are some manual aspects to the checks that will be performed, which can lead to wait times of around a day or two. <strong class="bold">Google</strong> notes that in some cases, additional checks may need to be performed that can take up to 7 days or longer. This can often be the case with new user accounts or apps when they are first being published. Once approved, your app will be visible in the Play Store on all supported Android devices.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-249"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this final chapter, we looked at how to package and distribute graphical applications using the Fyne tool. Unlike the distribution of command-line or system utilities, the process of delivering a GUI application requires additional metadata and packaging to integrate well with each OS. We saw how the basic release process can create an application package ready for distribution beyond our development and test team members.</p>
			<p>Packaging for different platforms can be complicated, so we walked through the steps required to build native-looking graphical packages for macOS, Windows, and Linux, as well as mobile packaging for iOS and Android. Each package has its own metadata format and package structure, but this was generated automatically using the <strong class="source-inline">fyne</strong> <strong class="source-inline">release</strong> tool.</p>
			<p>We also saw how to build release packages for distribution on official stores, and how these packages can be submitted to the app store or marketplace that will be preinstalled on the user's device. The Windows, macOS, iOS and Android stores provide an opportunity for applications to earn revenue following release, and the Linux software listings will help to increase the visibility of our software package. </p>
			<p>Having learned the various aspects of developing graphical apps using Fyne, we have made it all the way to a complete and published application. Hopefully, this guide has been helpful and has enabled you to create the app that you had been aiming to build and to get it working across all your devices over a range of OSes.</p>
