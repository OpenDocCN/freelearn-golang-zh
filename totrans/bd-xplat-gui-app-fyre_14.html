			<h1 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor253"/><em class="italic">Appendix A</em>: Developer Tool Installation</h1>
			<p>In preparation for running the code examples in this book, you will need to have both the <strong class="bold">Go</strong> compiler and a <strong class="bold">C</strong> compiler installed (to support <strong class="bold">CGo</strong>). If you don't have either of these set up, this appendix will guide you through the installation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Installing on Apple macOS</h1>
			<p>Many<a id="_idIndexMarker635"/> developer tools (including <strong class="bold">Git</strong>) are installed as<a id="_idIndexMarker636"/> part of the <strong class="bold">Xcode</strong> package. If you haven't already installed Xcode for other development work, you can download it for free from the <strong class="bold">Mac App Store</strong> at <a href="http://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835">apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835</a>.</p>
			<p>Once installed, you should also set up the command-line tools. To do this, go to the Xcode menu | <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong> | <strong class="bold">Downloads</strong> | <strong class="bold">Install Command Line Tools</strong>. If you're unsure about whether you've installed these already, then open the <strong class="bold">Terminal</strong> application and execute <strong class="source-inline">xcode-select</strong>. If the tools are already installed, this will execute normally. If not, you'll be prompted to run the installation, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>In addition to these tools, you'll need to install Go. You can get the download package from <a href="http://golang.org/dl">golang.org/dl</a>. From there, tap on the featured download link for Apple macOS, and then run the installer package that downloads. You may need to close any open <strong class="bold">Terminal</strong> windows to update your environment variables.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Installing on Microsoft Windows</h1>
			<p>Configuring a<a id="_idIndexMarker637"/> development environment for<a id="_idIndexMarker638"/> Windows can be complicated as there aren't many tools installed by default. Due to this, there are many options for setting up, including using external tools and packages (such as <strong class="bold">MSYS2</strong>, <strong class="bold">MinGW</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong>). However, exploring these is outside the scope of this book.</p>
			<p>The following steps show you how to get up and running using MSYS2, which provides a dedicated command-line application that will be set up for Fyne development. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You will need to download the installer from <a href="http://www.msys2.org">www.msys2.org</a>. You should choose either the 32-bit (<strong class="source-inline">i686</strong>) or 64-bit (<strong class="source-inline">x86_64</strong>) version, depending on your computer architecture.</li>
				<li>Once downloaded, run the installer, which will download the basic packages on your computer, including the package manager (<strong class="source-inline">pacman</strong>).</li>
				<li>Once the installation is complete, you'll be given the opportunity to launch the <strong class="bold">MSYS Command Prompt</strong> – <strong class="bold">please do not accept this</strong>, as this is not the version of the app we want to run.</li>
				<li>Once completed, open the directory you chose to install the application into	 and run the <strong class="source-inline">mingw64.exe</strong> application instead. This is the command line that comes pre-configured with knowledge of Windows compilation. We can now use the package <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>manager to install Go and Git, as well as the C compiler toolchain <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>and <strong class="source-inline">pkg-config</strong> (which is used by CGo to find packages):<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">$ pacman -S git mingw-w64-x86_64-go mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config</strong></p><p>The preceding command will offer to install many packages, which is want we want. Just tap the <em class="italic">Return</em> or <em class="italic">Enter</em> key to install these dependencies:</p></li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.2 – Running the installed Mingw64 terminal to install extra packages</p>
			<p>Note that the preceding terminal prompt denotes <strong class="bold">MINGW64</strong>. If you see <strong class="bold">MSYS2</strong> or another prompt, then you have opened the wrong terminal application.</p>
			<p>Once these packages <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>have been installed, you will<a id="_idIndexMarker642"/> have a full development environment. The default Go home path will be <strong class="source-inline">C:/Users/&lt;username&gt;/go</strong>, though you should consider adding <strong class="source-inline">C:/Users/&lt;username&gt;/go/bin</strong> to your <strong class="source-inline">%PATH%</strong> environment variable.</p>
			<p>Installing on Linux</p>
			<p>Setting up the <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>prerequisite software on Linux should only require<a id="_idIndexMarker644"/> installing the correct packages for your distribution. The <strong class="source-inline">git</strong> package will provide the source control tools, and the Go language should be in the <strong class="source-inline">go</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">golang</strong> package. Additionally, the CGo requirement means that the <strong class="source-inline">gcc</strong> package will need to be present as well. Installing these packages will provide the necessary commands to run the examples in this book. You may need to add <strong class="source-inline">~/go/bin</strong> to your <strong class="source-inline">PATH</strong> environment variable to be able to run tools that Go installs later.</p>
			<p>There are various different package managers for Linux, and each have slightly different naming conventions for packages, as well as different commands. The following commands are examples of how to install the required packages for each of the most popular distributions. Some platforms require additional library headers or dependencies to be installed, which are included where required:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Arch Linux</strong>: <strong class="bold">sudo pacman -S go gcc xorg-server-devel</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fedora</strong>: <strong class="bold">sudo dnf install golang gcc libXcursor-devel libXrandr-devel mesa-libGL-devel libXi-devel libXinerama-devel libXxf86vm-devel</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Solus</strong>: <strong class="bold">sudo eopkg it -c system.devel golang mesalib-devel libxrandr-devel libxcursor-devel libxi-devel libxinerama-devel</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ubuntu / Debian</strong>: <strong class="bold">sudo apt-get install golang gcc libgl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Void Linux</strong>: <strong class="bold">sudo xbps-install -S go base-devel xorg-server-devel libXrandr-devel libXcursor-devel libXinerama-devel</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>After using the<a id="_idIndexMarker645"/> aforementioned commands, you will have a full Fyne<a id="_idIndexMarker646"/> development environment ready on your computer.</p>
