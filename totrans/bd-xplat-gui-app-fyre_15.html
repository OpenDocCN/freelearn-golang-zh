			<p>Due to the way that mobile applications are compiled, they require additional tools and packages for testing or installation on devices. In this appendix, we’ll learn how to set up the additional components for <strong class="bold">iOS</strong> and <strong class="bold">Android</strong> development.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Preparing for Android</h1>
			<p>To develop <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>apps for Android, we will require additional development tools. Development follows the same process as we have seen in the earlier chapters of this book, and the same Fyne APIs are available for your application – it’s just the build/package phase that changes. Here are the necessary steps that we need to follow:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Firstly, you will need to install the Android SDK. The easiest way to do this is by installing <strong class="bold">Android Studio</strong>, which is<a id="_idIndexMarker648"/> available at <a href="http://developer.android.com/studio">developer.android.com/studio</a>. Tap the <strong class="bold">download</strong> button on that website and follow the installation instructions for your type of computer.</li>
				<li>Once the installation has completed, you will also need to install the <strong class="bold">Native Development Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">NDK</strong>), which is managed through the <strong class="bold">SDK Manager</strong>. This can be accessed through Android Studio by accessing the <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> menu and choosing <strong class="bold">SDK Manager</strong>. If you are not using Android Studio, then the same functionality can be seen by running the <strong class="source-inline">sdkmanager</strong> application.</li>
				<li>Once this has loaded, choose <strong class="bold">SDK Tools</strong> to see the full list of tooling available. Here, you will need to check the <strong class="bold">NDK</strong> option (sometimes called <strong class="bold">side by side</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Android SDK Tools</strong>, if they are not selected. Tap the <strong class="bold">Apply</strong> button and the packages will be installed, as follows:<div id="_idContainer123" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_12.1_B16820.jpg" alt="Figure 12.1 – The Android SDK manager (showing that the necessary SDK tools and NDK are installed)&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.1 – The Android SDK manager (showing that the necessary SDK tools and NDK are installed)</p></li>
				<li>Once this <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>has been set up, you should be able to build any Fyne app for your Android phone or tablet device using a command such as the following:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">$ fyne package -os android -appID com.example.myapp</strong></p><p>A successful command will create an <strong class="source-inline">.apk</strong> file that can be installed using the Android tools available to you, the <strong class="source-inline">adb install</strong> command, or the <strong class="source-inline">fyne install</strong> command.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is also possible to use <strong class="source-inline">fyne-cross</strong> for Android packaging, as shown in <a href="B16820_13_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor259"><em class="italic">Appendix C</em></a><em class="italic">: Cross Compiling</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Preparing for iOS and iPadOS</h1>
			<p>Building<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> apps for <strong class="bold">Apple</strong> mobile devices is a little different from <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>compiling your applications for macOS (desktop computers). Firstly, this must be done on an Apple Macintosh computer (<strong class="bold">iMac</strong>, <strong class="bold">MacBook Pro</strong>, and more) due to licensing restrictions.</p>
			<p>Secondly, you must have Xcode tools installed (this is somewhat optional for desktop app creation). Lastly, if you want to test on physical devices or distribute to the store, you will need to be signed up to the <strong class="bold">Apple developer program</strong>, which carries an annual cost.</p>
			<p>The Xcode installation is described in the <em class="italic">Apple macOS</em> section of <a href="B16820_11_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor253"><em class="italic">Appendix A</em></a><em class="italic">: Developer Tool Installation</em>. If you have previously done iOS development, this will already be set up.</p>
			<p>Next, you will need to have an Apple developer account. If you have not done so already, you can sign up at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/">developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/</a>. There is an annual fee, and if you publish apps but fail to renew your membership, they will be removed from the store. Once signed up, you should follow the documentation to set up a <strong class="bold">developer certificate</strong> and<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> add your devices to the account device list so that you can use them for testing. Once added, you will need to create <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>a <strong class="bold">provisioning profile</strong> – a single wildcard profile is sufficient for general development.</p>
			<p>Once you’ve done this, you should be able to build any Fyne app for your Apple phone or tablet device using a command such as the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">$ fyne package -os ios -appID com.example.myapp</strong></p>
			<p>Successfully executing the preceding command will create a <strong class="source-inline">.ipa</strong> file that can be installed on your devices for testing. This process is covered in more detail in <a href="B16820_09_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Bundling Resources and Preparing for Release</em>.</p>
