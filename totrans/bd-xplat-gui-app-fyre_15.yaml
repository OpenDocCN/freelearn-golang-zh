    tools and packages for testing or installation on devices. In this appendix, we’ll
    learn how to set up the additional components for **iOS** and **Android** development.

    Development follows the same process as we have seen in the earlier chapters of
    this book, and the same Fyne APIs are available for your application – it’s just
    the build/package phase that changes. Here are the necessary steps that we need
    to follow:'

- en: Firstly, you will need to install the Android SDK. The easiest way to do this
    is by installing **Android Studio**, which is available at [developer.android.com/studio](http://developer.android.com/studio).
    Tap the **download** button on that website and follow the installation instructions
    for your type of computer.

    application.

- en: Once this has loaded, choose **SDK Tools** to see the full list of tooling available.
    Here, you will need to check the **NDK** option (sometimes called **side by side**)
    and **Android SDK Tools**, if they are not selected. Tap the **Apply** button
    and the packages will be installed, as follows:![Figure 12.1 – The Android SDK

- en: Building apps for **Apple** mobile devices is a little different from compiling
    your applications for macOS (desktop computers). Firstly, this must be done on
    an Apple Macintosh computer (**iMac**, **MacBook Pro**, and more) due to licensing
    restrictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, you must have Xcode tools installed (this is somewhat optional for
    desktop app creation). Lastly, if you want to test on physical devices or distribute
    to the store, you will need to be signed up to the **Apple developer program**,
    which carries an annual cost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The Xcode installation is described in the *Apple macOS* section of [*Appendix
    A*](B16820_11_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor253)*: Developer Tool Installation*.
    If you have previously done iOS development, this will already be set up.'

- en: Next, you will need to have an Apple developer account. If you have not done
    so already, you can sign up at [developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/](http://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/).
    There is an annual fee, and if you publish apps but fail to renew your membership,
    they will be removed from the store. Once signed up, you should follow the documentation
    to set up a **developer certificate** and add your devices to the account device
    list so that you can use them for testing. Once added, you will need to create
    a **provisioning profile** – a single wildcard profile is sufficient for general
    development.

    can be installed on your devices for testing. This process is covered in more
    detail in [*Chapter 9*](B16820_09_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219), *Bundling
