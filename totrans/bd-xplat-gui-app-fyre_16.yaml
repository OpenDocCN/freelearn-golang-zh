- en: When building applications that need access to native APIs and graphics hardware,
    we can use **CGo**. Although not much harder to build for regular development,
    this does make cross compiling much more complicated. For every target platform
    you want to build for, there must be a **C compiler** that knows how to create
    native binary files. This appendix outlines the steps required to set up cross
    compilation targets for each combination referenced earlier in this book.

    For most development, you won't require the cross-compiler setup. The Go compiler
    and standard tools discussed in [*Appendix A*](B16820_11_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor253)*:*
    *Developer Tool Installation*, are all that you require to develop for standard
    computers. This appendix is all about installing additional tools for creating
    compiled applications for a different operating system or architecture than your
    current computer.

    for **Windows** (using **MSYS2**, as described in [*Appendix A*](B16820_11_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor253),

    32-bit binaries. If you wish to support older devices that are not 64-bit, you
