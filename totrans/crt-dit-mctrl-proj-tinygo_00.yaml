- en: If JavaScript or C# can run on microcontrollers, then Go can do it even better.
    While standard Go produces huge binaries, TinyGo produces binaries that fit on
    the smallest devices. Why should you choose Go for microcontroller and **Wasm**
    (short for **WebAssembly**) programming? My favorite reasons are that Go is easy
    to learn, easy to read, and easy to write. Also, Go comes with a powerful standard
    library that is loosely coupled and has strong concurrency capabilities included.

    this book, you'll have all the tools and knowledge you need to build all the microcontroller
    projects that you have ever dreamed of. Plus, as a further benefit, you will be
    able to build dashboards and home control apps using Wasm for your home automation
    projects. All of this can be achieved using TinyGo.

    appliances. It really is a great feeling to complete a project and finally see
    the motor turning, the LED blink, the buzzer beep, and so on.

- en: If you are a Go developer who wants to program low-powered devices and hardware
    such as Arduino UNO and Arduino Nano IoT 33, or if you are a Go developer who
    wants to extend your knowledge of using Go with WebAssembly while programming
    Go in the browser, then this book is for you. Go hobbyist programmers who are
    interested in learning more about TinyGo by working through DIY projects will
    also find this hands-on guide useful.
