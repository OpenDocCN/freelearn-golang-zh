			<p>Writing this book was great fun. I really enjoyed digging deeper than ever before into TinyGo. I found some problems along the way, created issues, contributed some drivers, and learned a lot. As a consequence of writing this book two new libraries have been created, TinyDom and TinySocket, which can be found on GitHub. </p>
			<p>I want to use this opportunity to thank all the people that helped me write this book. First of all there is Alok Dhuri, who found me in the wilds of the internet and gave me the opportunity to write this book. He also provided lots of genius ideas, which have been implemented in some of the projects.</p>
			<p>Also, I want to thank Nitee Shetty and Tiksha Abhimanyu Lad for helping me find a good flow in the book by providing tons of feedback on the style, and they also asked tons of good questions in order to get the best out of me.</p>
			<p>Also, thanks to everyone else on the Packt team for helping me to get this book done!</p>
			<p>And, of course, I want to take the chance to thank Enrico von Otte and Johannes Kolata for instantly accepting my request to be the technical reviewers of the book.</p>
			<p>Special thanks also go to Florian Puehl for explaining contract details to me, as well as Martin Nahrgang for helping in terms of PR topics.</p>
			<p>And what would an expression of gratitude be without thanking my parents, Carsten and Diana Theel, for raising me? </p>
