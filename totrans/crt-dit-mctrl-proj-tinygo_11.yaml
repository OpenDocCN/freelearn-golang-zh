    into TinyGo. I found some problems along the way, created issues, contributed
    some drivers, and learned a lot. As a consequence of writing this book two new
    libraries have been created, TinyDom and TinySocket, which can be found on GitHub.

    this book. First of all there is Alok Dhuri, who found me in the wilds of the
    internet and gave me the opportunity to write this book. He also provided lots
    of genius ideas, which have been implemented in some of the projects.

    a good flow in the book by providing tons of feedback on the style, and they also
    asked tons of good questions in order to get the best out of me.
