<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p><em class="italic">Full-Stack Web Development with Go</em> walks you through creating and developing a complete modern web service, from authn/authz, interop, server-side rendering, and databases, to modern frontend frameworks with Tailwind and Go-powered APIs, complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts, practical examples, and self-assessment questions. The book will begin by looking at how to structure the app and look at the relevant pieces, such as database and security, before integrating all the different parts together to build a complete <span class="No-Break">web product.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>Developers with experience of a mixture of frontend and backend development will be able to put their knowledge to work with the practical guide in this book. The book will give them the know-how to glue together their skills and allow them to build a complete stack <span class="No-Break">web application.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B18295_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Building the Database and Model</em>, looks at building our database for our sample application. We will also explore different ways to communicate with databases using Golang. </p>
<p><a href="B18295_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor029"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Application Logging</em>, considers how designing an application requires examining it internally without going through reams of code, and the only way to do this is by logging. We will learn how to do this by running a centralized logger that will host all of our logging information. We will also learn how to log from inside <span class="No-Break">our application.</span></p>
<p><a href="B18295_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Application Metrics and Tracing</em>, considers how having logging applied inside our application will assist in troubleshooting issues when the application is running. The other thing that helps is information about the interaction of the different components inside our application, which we will also look at in this chapter. </p>
<p><a href="B18295_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a><em class="italic">,</em><em class="italic"> Serving and Embedding HTML Content</em>, sees us begin work on implementing the REST endpoints needed for our financial application. The first version of the app will show simple content rendered by <span class="No-Break">the backend.</span></p>
<p><a href="B18295_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor070"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Securing the Backend and Middleware</em>, notes that we need to secure our application so that we can ensure users see only the data that they should. We will discuss some of the ways we can protect our endpoints using cookies, session management, and other types of <span class="No-Break">middleware available.</span></p>
<p><a href="B18295_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor093"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Moving to API - First</em>, starts by laying the groundwork for frontend applications to consume our data. We’ll introduce marshaling/unmarshaling data into custom structures and see how to set up JSON-consuming endpoints and use cURL <span class="No-Break">to verify.</span></p>
<p><a href="B18295_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor128"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Frontend Frameworks</em>, discusses the state of web development, introduces the React and Vue frameworks, and sees us employ them to create a simple app that's similar to our <span class="No-Break">previous one.</span></p>
<p><a href="B18295_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor153"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Frontend Libraries</em>, examines how to leverage tools and libraries to help us, as full stack developers, <span class="No-Break">work fast!</span></p>
<p><a href="B18295_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor184"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a><em class="italic">,</em><em class="italic"> Tailwind, Middleware, and CORS</em>, has us securing our app and getting it talking to our <span class="No-Break">Go-powered backend.</span></p>
<p><a href="B18295_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor198"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Session Management</em>, focuses on session management while introducing state management with Vuex and how to structure apps based on <span class="No-Break">user permissions.</span></p>
<p><a href="B18295_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor223"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Feature Flags</em>, introduces feature flags (sometimes called <em class="italic">feature toggles</em>) as a technique deployed to enable/disable certain features of the application as required, depending on a given condition. For example, if a newly deployed application containing a new feature has a bug and we know it will take time for the bug to be fixed, the decision can be made to turn off the feature without deploying any new code to do so. </p>
<p><a href="B18295_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor241"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Building Continuous Integration</em>, notes that while building applications is a big part of the puzzle, we need to be sure that what the team builds can be validated and tested properly. This is where continuous integration comes in. Having a proper continuous integration process is super important to ensure that everything deployed to production has been tested, verified, and <span class="No-Break">checked securely.</span></p>
<p><a href="B18295_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor261"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Dockerizing an Application</em>, notes that while developing an application is one side of the coin, the other side is to make sure that it can be deployed and used by our end user. To make deployment simpler, we can package applications such that they can be run inside a container. Operationally, this allows applications to be deployed in the cloud from anywhere. </p>
<p><a href="B18295_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor278"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Cloud Deployment</em>, shows how deploying applications to a cloud environment is the last step in delivering features for the end user to use. Cloud deployment is complex and sometimes quite specific to particular cloud vendors. In this chapter, we will focus on deploying applications into the AWS <span class="No-Break">cloud infrastructure.</span></p>
