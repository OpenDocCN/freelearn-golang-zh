- en: '*Full-Stack Web Development with Go* walks you through creating and developing
    a complete modern web service, from authn/authz, interop, server-side rendering,
    and databases, to modern frontend frameworks with Tailwind and Go-powered APIs,
    complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts, practical examples,
    and self-assessment questions. The book will begin by looking at how to structure
    the app and look at the relevant pieces, such as database and security, before
    integrating all the different parts together to build a complete web product.'

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B18295_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016)*, Building the Database and
    Model*, looks at building our database for our sample application. We will also
    explore different ways to communicate with databases using Golang.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B18295_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor029)*, Application Logging*, considers
    how designing an application requires examining it internally without going through
    reams of code, and the only way to do this is by logging. We will learn how to
    do this by running a centralized logger that will host all of our logging information.
    We will also learn how to log from inside our application.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B18295_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038)*, Application Metrics and Tracing*,
    considers how having logging applied inside our application will assist in troubleshooting
    issues when the application is running. The other thing that helps is information
    about the interaction of the different components inside our application, which
    we will also look at in this chapter.'

    Content*, sees us begin work on implementing the REST endpoints needed for our
    financial application. The first version of the app will show simple content rendered
    by the backend.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B18295_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor070)*, Securing the Backend and
    Middleware*, notes that we need to secure our application so that we can ensure
    users see only the data that they should. We will discuss some of the ways we
    can protect our endpoints using cookies, session management, and other types of
    middleware available.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B18295_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor093)*, Moving to API - First*, starts
    by laying the groundwork for frontend applications to consume our data. We’ll
    introduce marshaling/unmarshaling data into custom structures and see how to set
    up JSON-consuming endpoints and use cURL to verify.'

    the state of web development, introduces the React and Vue frameworks, and sees
    us employ them to create a simple app that''s similar to our previous one.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 11*](B18295_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor223)*, Feature Flags*, introduces
    feature flags (sometimes called *feature toggles*) as a technique deployed to
    enable/disable certain features of the application as required, depending on a
    given condition. For example, if a newly deployed application containing a new
    feature has a bug and we know it will take time for the bug to be fixed, the decision
    can be made to turn off the feature without deploying any new code to do so.'

- en: '[*Chapter 12*](B18295_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor241)*, Building Continuous Integration*,
    notes that while building applications is a big part of the puzzle, we need to
    be sure that what the team builds can be validated and tested properly. This is
    where continuous integration comes in. Having a proper continuous integration
    process is super important to ensure that everything deployed to production has
    been tested, verified, and checked securely.'

- en: '[*Chapter 13*](B18295_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor261)*, Dockerizing an Application*,
    notes that while developing an application is one side of the coin, the other
    side is to make sure that it can be deployed and used by our end user. To make
    deployment simpler, we can package applications such that they can be run inside
    a container. Operationally, this allows applications to be deployed in the cloud
    from anywhere.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 14*](B18295_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor278)*, Cloud Deployment*, shows
    how deploying applications to a cloud environment is the last step in delivering
    features for the end user to use. Cloud deployment is complex and sometimes quite
    specific to particular cloud vendors. In this chapter, we will focus on deploying
    applications into the AWS cloud infrastructure.'
