    them, and the benefits of using them. Using feature flags is not mandatory for
    applications. However, as application complexity increases, the need for feature
    flags will arise.

    we will focus on how to use feature flags to enable/disable certain features in
    an application. We will be using an open source, simple version of the feature
    flag server to demonstrate the integration for both frontend and backend services.

    out new features almost every single day, if not quicker. Sometimes, this requires
    features to be built even before there are any user needs. Having the ability
    to deploy features into production without disruption is the holy grail of software
    development.
  prefs: []

- en: Features that are deployed to production may or may not be made available to
    users; this all depends on tactical decisions on the business side. Developers
    will keep on releasing features to production and, when the time is right, the
    feature will be made available with a click of a button from the business side.
    This kind of facility is provided by the feature flag.

    features in our applications without creating disruption. Enabling features will
    also allow companies to strategically enable or disable features depending on
    the market and users’ needs, which can impact the bottom line of a company.
