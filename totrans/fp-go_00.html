			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Go is a multi-paradigm programming language. This means that both the object-oriented paradigm and the functional paradigm are entirely valid approaches to problem solving. In this book, we will explore the applications of functional programming techniques in Go. But rather than being purely focused on the functional aspect, we will embrace Go for what it is – multi-paradigm. This means that we highlight the difference between the functional and object-oriented ways of <span class="No-Break">problem solving.</span></p>
			<p>To write Go code that is more testable, readable, and reliable, we will look at functional-first approaches such as functions as first-class citizens, function purity, currying, and more. We will look not only at how to write functional code, but we will also explore the performance implications and limitations <span class="No-Break">of Go.</span></p>
			<p>The goal of this book is to get the reader accustomed to functional programming as a valid paradigm that can improve your code, no matter whether you’re working on a greenfield project or a project already entrenched in the <span class="No-Break">OO paradigm.</span></p>
			<p>For readers unfamiliar with the newly introduced generics in Go, this book also serves as an example of what’s possible now that generics are part of the standard library. Finally, we will also look at libraries that can be leveraged to write functional code for both pre-generic and post-generic versions <span class="No-Break">of Go.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>If you are a Go engineer with a background in traditionally object-oriented languages such as Java or C++ who wants to broaden your knowledge of functional programming, this book is for you. The book aims to teach you how concepts from functional programming can improve your existing Go code, as well as when to choose the functional approach. At each step, we highlight the trade-offs between the functional and object-oriented approaches to see how <span class="No-Break">they compare.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B18771_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing Functional Programming</em>, we are going to take a bird’s eye view of the <em class="italic">what</em> and <em class="italic">why</em> behind functional programming. To start, we will take a brief look at the history and contemporary state of functional programming methodologies. Then we will take a look at how functional programming compares to the more traditional <span class="No-Break">object-oriented programming.</span></p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B18771_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Treating Functions as First-Class Citizens</em>, we are going to cover exactly why functions are powerful in languages that treat them as <strong class="bold">first-class citizens</strong>. Go has functions as first-class citizens out of the box, meaning we get this functionality. We are going to see how this allows us to create function-centered constructs that improve the readability and testability of <span class="No-Break">our code.</span></p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B18771_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor047"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Higher-Order Functions</em>, we are going to explore the concept of function composition through higher-order functions. There are a variety of new concepts that are introduced here, such as closures, partial application, and function currying. We will take a look at some practical examples and real-world use cases <span class="No-Break">for these.</span></p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B18771_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Write Testable Code with Pure Functions</em>, we will take a look at what it means for a language, and a function, to be considered pure. We will take a look at some of the tradeoffs between function purity and impurity, and explore how pure functions help us write <span class="No-Break">testable code.</span></p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B18771_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Immutability</em>, we cover what exactly it means to be immutable, and how the Go language can help preserve immutability at the struct level. To understand how this works, we will look at how Go handles pointers and references to objects, what the performance implications are, and how to decide between the pointer-reference trade-offs. We will also dive into the implications for garbage collection, unit testing, and pure <span class="No-Break">functional programming.</span></p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B18771_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Three Common Categories of Functions</em>, we are going to look at some practical implementations of functions that leverage the concepts of functional programming covered up to now. We will build Filter functions, Map functions <span class="No-Break">and Reducers.</span></p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B18771_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor113"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Recursion</em>, we are going to talk about recursion. This is a topic that all programmers encounter sooner or later, as it’s not exclusive to the functional paradigm. Any language in which you can express function calls also allows you to express functions that are recursive in nature. But in functional languages, these take center stage. We will look at the implications for this <span class="No-Break">in Go.</span></p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B18771_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor126"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Readable Function Composition with Fluent Programming,</em> we are going to look at different methods for chaining functions in functional programming. The end goal here is to write code that is easier to read and creates less visual clutter. We will look at three ways for achieving this. First, we will take a look at how we can use type aliases to attach methods to container types, allowing us to create chained functions with the familiar <em class="italic">dot notation</em>. Next, we will look at continuation-passing style programming and consider the trade-offs of <span class="No-Break">each approach.</span></p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B18771_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Functional Design Patterns</em>, we will move to a higher level of abstraction. Rather than talking about individual functions and operations, we will look at design patterns. While we will not extensively explain each design pattern, we will take a look at how the object-oriented pattern translates to the <span class="No-Break">functional world.</span></p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B18771_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor147"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Concurrency and Functional Programming</em>, we consider how concurrency is all around us, both in the real world as well as the virtual one. In this chapter we will start by looking at concurrency, parallelism, and distributed computation. Next, we will focus on how the concurrency mechanisms in Go can help us write <span class="No-Break">functional code.</span></p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B18771_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor158"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Functional Programming Libraries</em>, we will explore several libraries that can help us build programs in the functional paradigm. We will look both at pre-generic libraries and <span class="No-Break">post-generic libraries.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Part 1: Functional Programming Paradigm Essentials</h1>
			<p>In this part, we will take a look at what the functional programming paradigm entails. We’ll look at how it compares to the traditional object-oriented approach, and learn some language design differences between programming languages in each paradigm. We’ll also discuss what it means for Go to be a multi-paradigm language and see how this benefits our use case. Finally, we’ll look at some key ideas in functional programming, which we can leverage to write more readable, maintainable, and <span class="No-Break">testable code.</span></p>
