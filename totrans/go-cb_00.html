<p>Thank you for choosing this book! I hope it will be a handy reference for developers to quickly look up Go development patterns. It is meant to be a companion to other resources and a reference that will hopefully be useful long after reading it once. Each recipe in this book includes working, simple, and tested code that can be used as a reference or foundation for your own applications. The book covers a range of content from basic to advanced topics.</p>

<p>This book is aimed for web developers, programmers, and enterprise developers. Basic knowledge of the Go language is assumed. Experience with backend application development is not necessary, but may help understand the motivation behind some of the recipes.</p>
<p>This book serves as a good reference for Go developers who are already proficient but need a quick reminder, example, or reference. With the open source repository, it should be possible to share these examples quickly with a team as well.</p>
