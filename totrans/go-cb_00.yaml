- en: Thank you for choosing this book! I hope it will be a handy reference for developers
    to quickly look up Go development patterns. It is meant to be a companion to other
    resources and a reference that will hopefully be useful long after reading it
    once. Each recipe in this book includes working, simple, and tested code that
    can be used as a reference or foundation for your own applications. The book covers
    a range of content from basic to advanced topics.
