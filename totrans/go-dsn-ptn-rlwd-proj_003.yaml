    1")*, Learning Go programming,* is a step-by-step, practical guide full of real
    world examples to help you get started with Go in no time at all. We start off
    by understanding the fundamentals of Go, followed by a detailed description of
    the Go data types, program structures and Maps. After this, you learn how to use
    Go concurrency idioms to avoid pitfalls and create programs that are exact in
    expected behavior. Next, you will be familiarized with the tools and libraries
    that are available in Go for writing and exercising tests, benchmarking, and code
    coverage.'

    GO such as, Network Programming and OS integration to build efficient applications.
    All the concepts are explained in a crisp and concise manner and by the end of
    this module; you would be able to create highly efficient programs that you can
    deploy over cloud.

    2"), *Go Design Patterns*, will provide readers with a reference point to software
    design patterns and CSP concurrency design patterns to help them build applications
    in a more idiomatic, robust, and convenient way in Go.'

- en: The module starts with a brief introduction to Go programming essentials and
    quickly moves on to explain the idea behind the creation of design patterns and
    how they appeared in the 90's as a common "language" between developers to solve
    common tasks in object-oriented programming languages. You will then learn how
    to apply the 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns in Go and also learn about
    CSP concurrency patterns, the "killer feature" in Go that has helped Google develop
    software to maintain thousands of servers.

    in an idiomatic way that will produce concise, readable, and maintainable software.

    3")*, Go Programming Blueprints - Second Edition,* will show you how to leverage
    all the latest features and much more. This module shows you how to build powerful
    systems and drops you into real-world situations. You will learn to develop high-quality
    command-line tools that utilize the powerful shell capabilities and perform well
    using Go''s in-built concurrency mechanisms. Scale, performance, and high availability
    lie at the heart of our projects, and the lessons learned throughout this module
    will arm you with everything you need to build world-class solutions. You will
    get a feel for app deployment using Docker and Google App Engine. Each project
    could form the basis of a start-up, which means they are directly applicable to
    modern software markets*.*'
