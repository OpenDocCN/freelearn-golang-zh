Go supports architectures including AMD64, x386, and ARM running the following operating systems:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Windows XP (or later)</li><li class="listitem">Mac OSX 10.7 (or later)</li><li class="listitem">Linux 2.6 (or later)</li><li class="listitem">FreeBSD 8 (or later)</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">Module 2: </p><p class="calibre10">Most of the chapters in this module are written following a simple TDD approach, here the requirements are written first, followed by some unit tests and finally the code that satisfies those requirements. We will use only tools that comes with the standard library of Go as a way to better understand the language and its possibilities. This idea is key to follow the module and understanding the way that Go solves problems, especially in distributed systems and concurrent applications.</p><p class="calibre10">Module 3: </p><p class="calibre10">To compile and run the code from this module, you will need a computer capable of running an operating system that supports the Go toolset, a list of which can be found at <a class="calibre1" href="https://golang.org/doc/install#requirements">https://golang.org/doc/install#requirements</a>
