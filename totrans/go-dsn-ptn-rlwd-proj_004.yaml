- en: Most of the chapters in this module are written following a simple TDD approach,
    here the requirements are written first, followed by some unit tests and finally
    the code that satisfies those requirements. We will use only tools that comes
    with the standard library of Go as a way to better understand the language and
    its possibilities. This idea is key to follow the module and understanding the
    way that Go solves problems, especially in distributed systems and concurrent
    applications.
