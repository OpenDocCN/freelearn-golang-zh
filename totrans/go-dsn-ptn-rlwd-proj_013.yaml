- en: In the first chapter of the book, you will be introduced to Go and take a tour
    of the features that have made the language a favorite among its adopters. The
    start of the chapter provides the motivation behind the Go programming language.
    If you are impatient, however, you are welcome to skip to any of the other topics
    and learn how to write your first Go program. Finally, the *Go in a nutshell*
    section provides a high-level summary of the characteristics of the language.
