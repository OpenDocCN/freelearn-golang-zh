The creators of the language have made available a simple way to familiarize yourself with the language without installing any tools. Known as the Go Playground, it is a web-based tool, accessible from <a class="calibre1" href="https://play.golang.org/">https://play.golang.org/</a>, that uses an editor metaphor to let developers test their Go skills by writing code directly within the web browser window. The Playground gives its users the ability to compile and run their code on Google's remote servers and get immediate results as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00002.jpeg" alt="Playing with Go" class="calibre14"/></div><p class="calibre15"> </p><p class="calibre10">The editor is basic, as it is meant to be used as a learning tool and a way to share code with others. The Playground includes practical features such as line numbers and formatting to ensure your code remains readable as it goes beyond a few lines long. Since this is a free service that consumes real compute resources, Google understandably imposes a few limitations on what can be done with Playground:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">You are restricted on the amount of memory your code will consume</li><li class="listitem">Long-running programs will be killed</li><li class="listitem">Access to files is simulated with an in-memory filesystem.</li><li class="listitem">Network access is simulated against the loopback interface only</li></ul></div></div></body></html>
