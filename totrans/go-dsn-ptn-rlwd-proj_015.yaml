    machine, let us take a look at the **Go Playground**. The creators of the language
    have made available a simple way to familiarize yourself with the language without
    installing any tools. Known as the Go Playground, it is a web-based tool, accessible
    from [https://play.golang.org/](https://play.golang.org/), that uses an editor
    metaphor to let developers test their Go skills by writing code directly within
    the web browser window. The Playground gives its users the ability to compile
    and run their code on Google''s remote servers and get immediate results as shown
    in the following screenshot:'

    to share code with others. The Playground includes practical features such as
    line numbers and formatting to ensure your code remains readable as it goes beyond
    a few lines long. Since this is a free service that consumes real compute resources,
    Google understandably imposes a few limitations on what can be done with Playground:'
