- en: Besides the Go Playground, how is one supposed to write Go code anyway? Writing
    Go does not require a fancy **Integrated Development Environment** (**IDE**).
    As a matter of fact, you can get started writing your simple Go programs with
    your favorite plain text editor that is bundled with your OS. There are, however,
    Go plugins for most major text editors (and full-blown IDEs) such as Atom, Vim,
    Emacs, Microsoft Code, IntelliJ, and many others. There is a complete list of
    editors and IDE plugins for Go which can be found at [https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins).
