At the time of writing, Go comes ready to be installed on the following major OS platforms:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Linux</li><li class="listitem">FreeBSD Unix</li><li class="listitem">Mac OSX</li><li class="listitem">Windows</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">The official installation packages are all available for 32-bit and 64-bit Intel-based architectures. There are also official binary releases that are available for ARM architectures as well. As Go grows in popularity, there will certainly be more binary distribution choices made available in the future.</p><p class="calibre10">Let us skip the detailed installation instructions as they will certainly change by the time you read this. Instead, you are invited to visit <a class="calibre1" href="http://golang.org/doc/install">http://golang.org/doc/install</a> and follow the directions given for your specific platform. Once completed, be sure to test your installation is working before continuing to use the following command:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">$&gt; go version</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">go version go1.6.1 linux/amd64</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">The previous command should print the version number, target OS, and the machine architecture where Go and its tools are installed. If you do not get an output similar to that preceding command, ensure to add the path of the Go binaries to your OS's execution <code class="email">PATH</code> environment variable.</p><p class="calibre10">Before you start writing your own code, ensure that you have properly set up your <code class="email">GOPATH</code>. This is a local directory where your Go source files and compiled artifacts are saved as you use the Go Toolchain. Follow the instructions found in <a class="calibre1" href="https://golang.org/doc/install#testing">https://golang.org/doc/install#testing</a> to set up your GOPATH.</p></div></div></body></html>
