    architectures. There are also official binary releases that are available for
    ARM architectures as well. As Go grows in popularity, there will certainly be

    your `GOPATH`. This is a local directory where your Go source files and compiled
    artifacts are saved as you use the Go Toolchain. Follow the instructions found
    in [https://golang.org/doc/install#testing](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing)
    to set up your GOPATH.
