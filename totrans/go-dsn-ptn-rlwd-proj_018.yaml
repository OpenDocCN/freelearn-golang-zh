- en: The programming examples presented throughout this book are available on the
    GitHub source code repository service. There you will find all source files grouped
    by chapters in the repository atÂ [https://github.com/vladimirvivien/learning-go/](https://github.com/vladimirvivien/learning-go/).
    To save the readers a few keystrokes, the examples use a shortened URL, that starts
    with `golang.fyi`, that points directly to the respective file in GitHub.

    the repository locally. Create a directory structure in your `GOPATH` so that
    the root of the source files is located at `$GOPATH/src/github.com/vladimirvivien/learning-go/`.
