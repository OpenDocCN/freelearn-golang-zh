    of the syntax and idioms used in the previous program. Nevertheless, when you
    read the code, there is a good chance you will be able to follow the logic and
    form a mental model of the program's flow. That is the beauty of Go's simplicity
    and the reason why so many programmers use it. If you are completely lost, no
    need to worry, as the subsequent chapters will cover all aspects of the language
    to get you going.
