- en: Source files containing Go functions can be further organized into directory
    structures known as a package. Packages are logical modules that are used to share
    code in Go as libraries. You can create your own local packages or use tools provided
    by Go to automatically pull and use remote packages from a source code repository.
    You will learn more about Go packages in [Chapter 6](part0042_split_000.html#181NK2-9c484ed022e64a0fb0e1aebf8e05d4fd
    "Chapter 6. Go Packages and Programs"), *Go Packages and Programs*.
