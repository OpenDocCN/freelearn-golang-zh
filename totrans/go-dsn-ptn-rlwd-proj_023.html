Your local Go source code is stored in the workspace, which is a directory convention that contains the source code and runtime artifacts. This makes it easy for Go tools to automatically find, build, and install compiled binaries. Additionally, Go tools rely on the <code class="email">workspace</code> setup to pull source code packages from remote repositories, such as Git, Mercurial, and Subversion, and satisfy their dependencies.</p></div></div></body></html>
