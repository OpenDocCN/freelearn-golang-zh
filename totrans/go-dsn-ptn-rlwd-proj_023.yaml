- en: Go follows a simple code layout convention to reliably organize source code
    packages and to manage their dependencies. Your local Go source code is stored
    in the workspace, which is a directory convention that contains the source code
    and runtime artifacts. This makes it easy for Go tools to automatically find,
    build, and install compiled binaries. Additionally, Go tools rely on the `workspace`
    setup to pull source code packages from remote repositories, such as Git, Mercurial,
    and Subversion, and satisfy their dependencies.
