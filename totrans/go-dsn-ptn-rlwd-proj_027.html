Go types do not use a class hierarchy to model the world as is the case with other object-oriented languages. However, Go can support the object-based development idiom, allowing data to receive behaviors. This is done by attaching functions, known as methods, to named types.</p><p class="calibre10">The following snippet, extracted from the metalloid example, shows the type <code class="email">amu</code> receiving a method called <code class="email">float()</code> that returns the mass as a <code class="email">float64</code> value:</p><pre class="programlisting">type amu float64 
 
func (mass amu) float() float64 { 
    return float64(mass) 
}
