When a developer creates a <code class="email">slice</code> (think <code class="email">array</code>) of bytes, for instance, there is a direct representation of those bytes in the underlying physical memory of the machine. Furthermore, Go borrows the notion of pointers to represent the memory addresses of stored values giving Go programs the support of passing function parameters by both value and reference.</p><p class="calibre10">Go asserts a highly opinionated safety barrier around memory management with little to no configurable parameters. Go automatically handles the drudgery of bookkeeping for memory allocation and release using a runtime garbage collector. Pointer arithmetic is not permitted at runtime; therefore, developers cannot traverse memory blocks by adding to or subtracting from a base memory address.</p></div></div></body></html>
