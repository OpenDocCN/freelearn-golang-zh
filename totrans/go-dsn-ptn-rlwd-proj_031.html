This is made possible with features such as a simple syntax, conflict-free grammar, and a strict identifier resolution that forbids unused declared resources such as imported packages or variables. Furthermore, the build system resolves packages using transitivity information stored in the closest source node in the dependency tree. Again, this reduces the code-compile-run cycle to feel more like a dynamic language instead of a compiled language.</p></div></div></body></html>
