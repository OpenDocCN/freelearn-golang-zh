- en: Another one of Go's attractions is its millisecond build-time for moderately-sized
    projects. This is made possible with features such as a simple syntax, conflict-free
    grammar, and a strict identifier resolution that forbids unused declared resources
    such as imported packages or variables. Furthermore, the build system resolves
    packages using transitivity information stored in the closest source node in the
    dependency tree. Again, this reduces the code-compile-run cycle to feel more like
    a dynamic language instead of a compiled language.
