The basic rule is: <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">you declare it, you must use it</em></span>. If you attempt to compile code with unused identifiers such as variables or named packages, the compilers will not be pleased and will fail compilation.</p><p class="calibre10">Go allows you to turn off this behavior using the blank identifier, represented by the <code class="email">_</code> (underscore) character. Any declaration or assignment that uses the blank identifier is not bound to any value and is ignored at compile time. The blank identifier is usually used in two contexts, as listed in the following subsections.</p></div></div></body></html>
