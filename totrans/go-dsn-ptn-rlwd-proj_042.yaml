- en: 'The Go compiler is particularly strict about the use of declared identifiers
    for variables or packages. The basic rule is: *you declare it, you must use it*.
    If you attempt to compile code with unused identifiers such as variables or named
    packages, the compilers will not be pleased and will fail compilation.'

- en: Go allows you to turn off this behavior using the blank identifier, represented
    by the `_` (underscore) character. Any declaration or assignment that uses the
    blank identifier is not bound to any value and is ignored at compile time. The
    blank identifier is usually used in two contexts, as listed in the following subsections.
