    must be assigned to a variable identifier. In some cases, however, it may be desirable
    to mute unwanted results from the return list while keeping others, as shown in
    the following call:'

    takes a path and returns two values: the first is the parent path (`/opt/data`)
    and the second is the file name (`bigdata.txt`). The first value is assigned to
    the blank identifier and is, therefore, unbounded to a named identifier, which
    causes it to be ignored by the compiler. In future discussions, we will explore
    other uses of this idiom''s other contexts, such as error-handling and `for` loops.'
