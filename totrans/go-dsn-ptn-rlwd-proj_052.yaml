    of Go's grammar, they are generally viewed as a source of confusion for newcomers
    to the language. For instance, the colon-equal operator cannot be used with package-level
    variables assignments. Developers learning Go may find it compelling to use the
    assignment operator as a way to update a variable, but that would cause a compilation
    error.
