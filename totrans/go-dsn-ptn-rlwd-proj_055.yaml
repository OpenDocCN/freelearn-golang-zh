- en: In Go, a constant is a value with a literal representation such as a string
    of text, Boolean, or numbers. The value for a constant is static and cannot be
    changed after initial assignment. While the concept they represent is simple,
    constants, however, have some interesting properties that make them useful, especially
    when working with numeric values.
