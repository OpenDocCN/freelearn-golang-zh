One of the most interesting properties of constants is that their literal representations can either be treated as typed or untyped values. Unlike variables, which are intrinsically bound to a type, constants can be stored as untyped values in memory space. Without that type constraint, numeric constant values, for instance, can be stored with great precision.</p><p class="calibre10">The followings are examples of valid constant literal values that can be expressed in Go:</p><pre class="programlisting">"Mastering Go"
