- en: Constants are values that can be represented by a text literal in the language.
    One of the most interesting properties of constants is that their literal representations
    can either be treated as typed or untyped values. Unlike variables, which are
    intrinsically bound to a type, constants can be stored as untyped values in memory
    space. Without that type constraint, numeric constant values, for instance, can
    be stored with great precision.
