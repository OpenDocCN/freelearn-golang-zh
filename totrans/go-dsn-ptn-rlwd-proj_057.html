Similar to a variable declaration, Go uses the <code class="email">const</code> keyword to indicate the declaration of a constant. Unlike variables, however, the declaration must include the literal value to be bound to the identifier, as shown in the following format:</p><p class="calibre10"><span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">const &lt;identifier list&gt; type = &lt;value list or initializer expressions&gt;</em></span></p><p class="calibre10">Constants cannot have any dependency that requires runtime resolution. The compiler must be able to resolve the value of a constant at compile time. This means all constants must be declared and initialized with a value literal (or an expression that results to a constant value).</p><p class="calibre10">The following snippet shows some typed constants being declared:</p><pre class="programlisting">const a1, a2 string = "Mastering", "Go" 
const b rune = 'G' 
const c bool = false 
const d int32 = 111009 
const e float32 = 2.71828 
const f float64 = math.Pi * 2.0e+3 
const g complex64 = 5.0i 
const h time.Duration = 4 * time.Second 
</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch02/const.go</p><p class="calibre10">Notice in the previous source snippet that each declared constant identifier is explicitly given a type. As you would expect, this implies that the constant identifier can only be used in contexts that are compatible with its types. However, the next section explains how this works differently when the type is omitted in the constant declaration.</p></div></div></body></html>
