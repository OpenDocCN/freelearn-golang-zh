An untyped constant is declared as follows:</p><p class="calibre10"><span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">const &lt;identifier list&gt; = &lt;value list or initializer expression&gt;</em></span></p><p class="calibre10">As before, the keyword <code class="email">const</code> is used to declare a list of identifiers as constants along with their respective bounded values. However, in this format, the type specification is omitted in the declaration. As an untyped entity, a constant is merely a blob of bytes in memory without any type precision restrictions imposed. The following shows some sample declarations of untyped constants:</p><pre class="programlisting">const i = "G is" + " for Go " 
const j = 'V' 
const k1, k2 = true, !k1 
const l = 111*100000 + 9 
const m1 = math.Pi / 3.141592 
const m2 = 1.414213562373095048801688724209698078569671875376... 
const m3 = m2 * m2 
const m4 = m3 * 1.0e+400 
const n = -5.0i * 3 
const o = time.Millisecond * 5 
</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch02/const.go</p><p class="calibre10">From the previous code snippet, the untyped constant <code class="email">m2</code> is assigned a long decimal value (truncated to fit on the printed page as it goes another 17 digits). Constant <code class="email">m4</code> is assigned a much larger number of <code class="email">m3 x 1.0e+400</code>. The entire value of the resulting constant is stored in memory without any loss in precision. This can be an extremely useful tool for developers interested in computations where a high level of precision is important.</p></div></div></body></html>
