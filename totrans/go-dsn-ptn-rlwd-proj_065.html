There are no hidden surprise behaviors with Go operators as there is no support for operator-overloading as found in C++ or Scala. This was a deliberate decision from the designers to keep the semantics of the language simple and predictable.</p><p class="calibre10">This section explores the most common operators that you will encounter as you start with Go. Other operators are covered throughout other chapters of the book.</p></div></body></html>
