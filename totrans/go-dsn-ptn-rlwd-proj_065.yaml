- en: Staying true to its simplistic nature, operators in Go do exactly what you would
    expect, mainly, they allow operands to be combined into expressions. There are
    no hidden surprise behaviors with Go operators as there is no support for operator-overloading
    as found in C++ or Scala. This was a deliberate decision from the designers to
    keep the semantics of the language simple and predictable.
