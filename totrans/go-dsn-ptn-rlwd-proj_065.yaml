- en: Staying true to its simplistic nature, operators in Go do exactly what you would
    expect, mainly, they allow operands to be combined into expressions. There are
    no hidden surprise behaviors with Go operators as there is no support for operator-overloading
    as found in C++ or Scala. This was a deliberate decision from the designers to
    keep the semantics of the language simple and predictable.

  zh: 始终忠于其简洁的本质，Go 中的操作符正是你所期望的，主要来说，它们允许操作数被组合成表达式。与 C++ 或 Scala 中所发现的操作符重载不同，Go
    操作符没有隐藏的意外行为，因为 Go 不支持操作符重载。这是设计者有意做出的决定，以保持语言的语义简单和可预测。
