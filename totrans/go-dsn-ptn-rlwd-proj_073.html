It started with the structure of Go's source code text file and progressed to cover variable identifiers, declarations, and initializations. The chapter also provided extensive coverage of Go constants, constant declaration, and operators.</p><p class="calibre10">At this point, you may feel a bit overwhelmed by so much pedestrian information about the language and its syntax. The good news is that you don't have to know all of these details to be productive with the language. In the following chapters, we will continue to explore some of the more interesting bits about Go, including data types, functions, and packages.</p></div></body></html>
