    It started with the structure of Go's source code text file and progressed to
    cover variable identifiers, declarations, and initializations. The chapter also
    provided extensive coverage of Go constants, constant declaration, and operators.

    about the language and its syntax. The good news is that you don't have to know
    all of these details to be productive with the language. In the following chapters,
    we will continue to explore some of the more interesting bits about Go, including
    data types, functions, and packages.
