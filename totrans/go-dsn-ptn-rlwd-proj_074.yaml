- en: 'Go borrows several of its control flow syntax from the C-family of languages.
    It supports all of the expected control structures, including `if...else`, `switch`,
    `for` loop, and even `goto`. Conspicuously absent, though, are `while` or `do...while`
    statements. The following topics in this chapter examine Go''s control flow elements,
    some of which you may already be familiar with, and others that bring a new set
    of functionalities not found in other languages:'
