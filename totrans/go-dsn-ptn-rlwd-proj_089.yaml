    label used by these statements. Declaring a label in Go requires an identifier
    followed by a colon, as shown in the following snippet:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Naming your label is a matter of style. However, one should follow the identifier
    naming guidelines covered in the previous chapter. A label must be enclosed within
    a function. The Go compiler will not allow unused labels to dangle in the code.
    Similar to variables, if a label is declared, it must be referenced in the code.
