While Go's flow control constructs appear simple and easy to use, they are powerful and implement all branching primitives expected of a modern language. Readers are introduced to each concept with ample detail and examples to ensure clarity of the topics. The next chapter continues our look into Go fundamentals by introducing the reader to the Go type systems.</p></div></body></html>
