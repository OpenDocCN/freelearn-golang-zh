- en: This chapter provided a walkthrough of the mechanism of control flow in Go,
    including `if`, `switch`, and `for` statements. While Go's flow control constructs
    appear simple and easy to use, they are powerful and implement all branching primitives
    expected of a modern language. Readers are introduced to each concept with ample
    detail and examples to ensure clarity of the topics. The next chapter continues
    our look into Go fundamentals by introducing the reader to the Go type systems.
