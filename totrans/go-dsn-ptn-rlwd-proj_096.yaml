- en: Go's numeric types include support for integral and decimal values with a variety
    of sizes ranging from 8 to 64 bits. Each numeric type has its own layout in memory
    and is considered unique by the type system. As a way of enforcing this, and to
    avoid any sort of confusion when porting Go on different platforms, the name of
    a numeric type reflects its size requirement. For instance, type `*int16*` indicates
    an integer type that uses 16 bits for internal storage*.* This means that numberic
    values must be explicitly be converted when crossing type boundaries in assignments,
    expressions, and operations.

    to the blank identifier. However, it illustrates all of the numeric data types
    supported in Go.
