Go can treat character and string literal constants in its source code as Unicode. It is a global standard whose goal is to catalog symbols for known writing systems by assigning a numerical value (known as code point) to each character.</p><p class="calibre10">By default, Go inherently supports UTF-8 which is an efficient way of encoding and storing Unicode numerical values. That is all the background needed to continue with this subject. No further detail will be discussed as it is beyond the scope of this book.</p></div></body></html>
