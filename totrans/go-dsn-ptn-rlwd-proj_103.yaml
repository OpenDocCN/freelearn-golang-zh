- en: In order to start our discussion about the `rune` and `string` types, some background
    context is in order. Go can treat character and string literal constants in its
    source code as Unicode. It is a global standard whose goal is to catalog symbols
    for known writing systems by assigning a numerical value (known as code point)
    to each character.

- en: By default, Go inherently supports UTF-8 which is an efficient way of encoding
    and storing Unicode numerical values. That is all the background needed to continue
    with this subject. No further detail will be discussed as it is beyond the scope
    of this book.
