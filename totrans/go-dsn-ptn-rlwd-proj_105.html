Once a string value is assigned to a variable, the value of that string is never changed. Typically, string values are represented as constant literals enclosed within double quotes as shown in the following example:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00010.jpeg" alt="The string" class="calibre14"/><div class="caption"><p class="calibre16">golang.fyi/ch04/string.go</p></div></div><p class="calibre15"> </p><p class="calibre10">The previous snippet shows variable <code class="email">txt</code> being assigned a string literal containing seven characters including two embedded Chinese characters. As referenced earlier, the Go compiler will automatically interpret string literal values as Unicode characters and encode them using UTF-8. This means that under the cover, each literal character is stored as a <code class="email">rune</code> and may end up taking more than one byte for storage per visible character. In fact, when the program is executed, it prints the length of <code class="email">txt</code> as <code class="email">11</code>, instead of the expected seven characters for the string, accounting for the additional bytes used for the Chinese symbols.</p></div></div></body></html>
