["```go\ntxt being assigned a string literal containing seven characters including two embedded Chinese characters. As referenced earlier, the Go compiler will automatically interpret string literal values as Unicode characters and encode them using UTF-8\\. This means that under the cover, each literal character is stored as a rune and may end up taking more than one byte for storage per visible character. In fact, when the program is executed, it prints the length of txt as 11, instead of the expected seven characters for the string, accounting for the additional bytes used for the Chinese symbols.\n```"]
