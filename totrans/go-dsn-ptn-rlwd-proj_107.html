As with other C-family languages, pointers in Go provide a level of indirection that let programmers process data more efficiently without having to copy the actual data value every time it is needed.</p><p class="calibre10">Unlike C, however, the Go runtime maintains control of the management of pointers at runtime. A programmer cannot add an arbitrary integer value to the pointer to generate a new pointer address (a practice known as pointer arithmetic). Once an area of memory is referenced by a pointer, the data in that area will remain reachable until it is no longer referenced any pointer variable. At that point, the unreferenced value becomes eligible for garbage collection.</p></div></body></html>
