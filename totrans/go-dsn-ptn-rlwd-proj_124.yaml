- en: 'It is worth noting that an anonymous function does not have to be bound to
    an identifier. The function literal can be evaluated, in place, as an expression
    that returns the function''s result. This is done by ending the function literal
    with a list of argument values, enclosed in parentheses, as shown in the following
    program:'

- en: Since the function literal ends with a parameter list enclosed within parentheses,
    the function is invoked as an expression.
