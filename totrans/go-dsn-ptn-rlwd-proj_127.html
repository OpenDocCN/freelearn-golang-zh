If you have worked with languages such as Python, Java, or C#, you may be familiar with interrupting the flow of your executing code by throwing an exception when an undesirable state arises.</p><p class="calibre10">As we will explore in this section, Go has a simplified approach to error signaling and error handling that puts the onus on the programmer to handle possible errors immediately after a called function returns. Go discourages the notion of interrupting an execution by indiscriminately short-circuiting the executing program with an exception in the hope that it will be properly handled further up the call stack. In Go, the traditional way of signaling errors is to return a value of type <code class="email">error</code> when something goes wrong during the execution of your function. So let us take a closer look how this is done.</p></div></body></html>
