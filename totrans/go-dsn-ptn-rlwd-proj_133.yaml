- en: Earlier in the chapter, it was stated that Go does not have the traditional
    exception mechanism offered by other languages. Nevertheless, in Go, there is
    a way to abruptly exit an executing function known as function panic. Conversely,
    when a program is panicking, Go provides a way of recovering and regaining control
    of the execution flow.
