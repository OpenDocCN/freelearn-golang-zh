- en: This chapter presented its reader with an exploration of Go functions. It started
    with an overview of named function declarations, followed by a discussion on function
    parameters. The chapter delved into a discussion of function types and function
    values. The last portion of the chapter discussed the semantics of error handling,
    panic, and recovery. The next chapter continues the discussion of functions; however,
    it does so within the context of Go packages. It explains the role of a package
    as a logical grouping of Go functions (and other code elements) to form sharable
    and callable code modules.
