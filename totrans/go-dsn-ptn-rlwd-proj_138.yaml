- en: Similar to other languages, Go source code files are grouped into compilable
    and sharable units known as packages. However, all Go source files must belong
    to a package (there is no such notion as a default package). This strict approach

    favoring convention over configuration. Let us take a deep dive into the fundamentals
    of packages, their creation, use, and recommended practice.
