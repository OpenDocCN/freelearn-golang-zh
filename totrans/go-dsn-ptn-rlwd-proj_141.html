On a Linux machine, for instance, where the root directory for the workspace is <code class="email">/home/username/Go</code>, the workspace would be set as:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">$&gt; export GOPATH=/home/username/Go </strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">When setting up the <code class="email">GOPATH</code> environment variable, it is possible to specify multiple locations where packages are stored. Each directory is separated by an OS-dependent path delimiter character (in other words, colon for Linux/Unix, semi-colon for Windows) as shown below:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">$&gt; export GOPATH=/home/myaccount/Go;/home/myaccount/poc/Go</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">The Go tools will search all listed locations in the <code class="email">GOPATH</code> when resolving package names. The Go compiler will, however, only store compiled artifacts, such as object and binary files, in the first directory location assigned to <code class="email">GOPATH</code>.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note11" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">The ability to configure your workspace by simply setting an OS environmental variable has tremendous advantages. It gives developers the ability to dynamically set the workspace at compile time to meet certain workflow requirements. For instance, a developer may want to test an unverified branch of code prior to merging it. He or she may want to set up a temporary workspace to build that code as follows (Linux): <code class="email">$&gt; GOPATH=/temporary/go/workspace/path go build</code></p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
