    using the `package` clause, as the first legal statement in a Go source file.
    The declared package consists of the `package` keyword followed by a name identifier.
    The following shows source file `volt.go` from the `volt` package:'

- en: The package identifier in the source file can be set to any arbitrary value.
    Unlike, say, Java, the name of the package does not reflect the directory structure
    where the source file is located. While there are no requirements for the package
    name, it is an accepted convention to name the package identifier the same as
    the directory where the file is located. In our previous source listing, the package
    is declared with identifier `volt` because the file is stored inside the *volt*
    directory.
