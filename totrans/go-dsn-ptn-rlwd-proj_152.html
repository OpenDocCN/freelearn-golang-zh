A named package can be used as a way to shorten or customize the name of a package. For instance, in a large source file with numerous usage of a certain package, this can be a welcome feature to reduce keystrokes.</p><p class="calibre10">Assigning a name to a package is also a way to avoid package identifier collisions in a given source file. It is conceivable to import two or more packages, with different import paths, that resolve to the same package names. As an example, you may need to log information with two different logging systems from different libraries, as illustrated in the following code snippet:</p><pre class="programlisting">package foo 
import ( 
   flog "github.com/woom/bat/logger" 
   hlog "foo/bar/util/logger" 
) 
 
func main() { 
   flog.Info("Programm started") 
   err := doSomething() 
   if err != nil { 
     hlog.SubmitError("Error - unable to do something") 
   } 
} 
 
</pre><p class="calibre10">As depicted in the previous snippet, both logging packages will resolve to the same name identifier of <code class="email">"logger"</code> by default. To resolve this, at least one of the imported packages must be assigned a name identifier to resolve the name clash. In the previous example, both import paths were named with a meaningful name to help with code comprehension.</p></div></div></body></html>
