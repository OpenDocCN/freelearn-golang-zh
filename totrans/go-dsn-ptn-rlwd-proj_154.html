Failure to do so will result in a compilation error. While this feature helps simplify package dependency resolution, it can be cumbersome, especially in the early phase of a developing code.</p><p class="calibre10">Using the blank identifier (similar to variable declarations) causes the compiler to bypass this requirement. For instance, the following snippet imports the built-in package <code class="email">fmt</code>; however, it never uses it in the subsequent source code:</p><pre class="programlisting">package foo 
import ( 
   _ "fmt" 
   "foo/bar/util/logger" 
) 
 
func main() { 
   err := doSomething() 
   if err != nil { 
     logger.Submit("Error - unable to do something") 
   } 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">A common idiom for the blank identifier is to load packages for their side effects. This relies on the initialization sequence of packages when they are imported (see the following <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Package initialization</em></span> section). Using the blank identifier will cause an imported package to be initialized even when none of its members can referenced. This is used in contexts where the code is needed to silently run certain initialization sequences.</p></div></div></body></html>
