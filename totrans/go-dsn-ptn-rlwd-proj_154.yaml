- en: A common idiom for the blank identifier is to load packages for their side effects.
    This relies on the initialization sequence of packages when they are imported
    (see the following *Package initialization* section). Using the blank identifier
    will cause an imported package to be initialized even when none of its members
    can referenced. This is used in contexts where the code is needed to silently
    run certain initialization sequences.
