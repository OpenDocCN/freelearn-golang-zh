When you build source files of an executable Go program, the compiler will generate an executable binary file by transitively linking all the decencies declared in the <code class="email">main</code> package. The build tool will name the output binary, by default the same name as the directory where the Go program source files are located.</p><p class="calibre10">For instance, in the Ohm's Law example, the file <code class="email">main.go</code>, which is located in the directory <code class="email">github.com/vladimirvivien/learning-go/ch06</code>, is declared to be part of the <code class="email">main</code> package. The program can be built as shown in the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">$&gt; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/vladimirvivien/learning-go/ch06
$&gt; go build .</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">When the <code class="email">main.go</code> source file is built, the build tool will generate a binary named <code class="email">ch06</code> because the source code for the program is located in a directory with that name. You can control the name of the binary using the output flag <code class="email">-o</code>. In the following example, the build tool creates a binary file named <code class="email">ohms</code>.</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">$&gt; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/vladimirvivien/learning-go/ch06
$&gt; go build -o ohms</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">Lastly, installing a Go program is done in exactly the same way as installing a regular package using the Go <code class="email">install</code> command:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">$&gt; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/vladimirvivien/learning-go/ch06
$&gt; go install .</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">When a program is installed using the Go install command, it will be built, if necessary, and its generated binary will be saved in the <code class="email">$GOPAHT/bin</code> directory. Adding the workspace <code class="email">bin</code> directory to your OS's <code class="email">$PATH</code> environment variable will make your Go program available for execution.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note14" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">Go-generated programs are statically linked binaries. They require no additional dependencies to be satisfied to run. However, Go-compiled binaries include the Go runtime. This is the set of operations that handle functionalities such as garbage collection, type information, reflection, goroutines scheduling, and panic management. While a comparable C program would be order of magnitudes smaller, Go's runtime comes with the tools that make Go enjoyable.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
