- en: In order for Go to pull package source code from a remote repository, you must
    have a client for that version control system installed as a command on your operating
    system's execution path. Under the cover, Go launches the client to interact with
    the source code repository server.

    using a fully qualified project path as the import path for the package. Once
    the package is downloaded, it can be imported for use in local source files. For

    dependencies. The tool will then build and install the package artifacts in `$GOPATH/pkg`.
    If the `import` path happens to be a program, go get will generate the binary
    in `$GOPATH/bin` as well as any referenced packages in `$GOPATH/pkg`.
