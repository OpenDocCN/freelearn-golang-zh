Readers learned about the Go workspace and the import path. Readers were also introduced to the creation of packages and how to import packages to achieve code reusability. The chapter introduced mechanisms such as visibility of imported members and package initialization. The last portion of the chapter discussed the steps that are necessary to create an executable Go program from packaged code.</p><p class="calibre10">This was a lengthy chapter, and deservedly so to do justice to such a broad topic as package creation and management in Go. The next chapter returns to the Go types discussion with a detailed treatment of the composite types, such as array, slice, struct, and map.</p></div></body></html>
