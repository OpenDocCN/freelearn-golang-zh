The following code snippet shows samples of variables that are assigned array types:</p><pre class="programlisting">var val [100]int 
var days [7]string 
var truth [256]bool 
var histogram [5]map[string]int 
</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch07/arrtypes.go</p><p class="calibre10">Notice the types that are assigned to each variable in the previous example are specified using the following type format:</p><p class="calibre10"><span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">[&lt;length&gt;]&lt;element_type&gt;</em></span></p><p class="calibre10">The type definition of an array is composed of its length, enclosed within brackets, followed by theÂ type of its stored elements. For instance, the <code class="email">days</code> variable is assigned a type <code class="email">[7]string</code>. This is an important distinction as Go's type system considers two arrays, storing the same type of elements but with different lengths, to be of different types. The following code illustrates this situation:</p><pre class="programlisting">var days [7]string 
var weekdays [5]string 
</pre><p class="calibre10">Even though both variables are arrays with elements of type <code class="email">string</code>, the type system considers the <code class="email">days</code> and <code class="email">weekdays</code> variables as different types.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note16" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">Later in the chapter, you will see how this type restriction is mitigated with the use of the slice type instead of arrays.</p></div><p class="calibre10">Array types can be defined to be multi-dimensions. This is done by combining and nesting the definition of one-dimensional array types as shown in the following snippet:</p><pre class="programlisting">var board [4][2]int
var matrix [2][2][2][2] byte</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch07/arrtypes.go</p><p class="calibre10">Go does not have a separate type for multi-dimensional arrays. An array with more than one dimension is composed of one-dimensional arrays that are nested within each other. The next section covers how single and multi-dimensional arrays are initialized.</p></div></div></body></html>
