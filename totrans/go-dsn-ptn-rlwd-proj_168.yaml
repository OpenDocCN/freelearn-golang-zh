- en: Arrays values are treated as a single unit. An array variable is not a pointer
    to a location in memory, but rather represents the entire block of memory containing
    the array elements. This has the implications of creating a new copy of an array
    value when the array variable is reassigned or passed in as a function parameter.

- en: 'This could have unwanted side effects on memory consumption for a program.
    One fix for is to use pointer types to reference array values. In the following
    example, a named type, `numbers`, is declared to represent array type `[1024 *
    1024]]int`. Instead of taking the array value directly as parameters, functions
    `initialize()` and `max()` receive a pointer of type `*numbers`, as shown in the
    following source snippet:'

- en: The array type is a low-level storage construct in Go. Arrays, for instance,
    are usually used as the basis for storage primitives, where there are strict memory
    allocation requirements to minimize space consumption. In more common cases however,
    the slice, covered in the next section, is often used as the more idiomatic way
    of working with sequenced indexed collections.
