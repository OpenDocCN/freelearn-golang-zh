The slice is more flexible and has many more interesting characteristics than arrays. The slice itself is a composite type with semantics similar to arrays. In fact, a slice uses an array as its underlying data storage mechanism. The general form of a slice type is given as follows:</p><p class="calibre10"><span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">[ ]&lt;element_type&gt;</em></span></p><p class="calibre10">The one obvious difference between a slice and an array type is omission of the size in the type declaration, as shown in the following examples:</p><pre class="programlisting">var ( 
    image []byte      
    ids []string 
    vector []float64 
    months []string 
    q1 []string 
    histogram []map[string]int // slice of map (see map later) 
) 
</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch07/slicetypes.go</p><p class="calibre10">The missing size attribute in the slice type indicates the following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Unlike arrays, the size of a slice is not fixed</li><li class="listitem">A slice type represents all sets of the specified element type</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">This means a slice can theoretically grow unbounded (though in practice this is not true as the slice is backed by an underlying bounded array). A slice of a given element type is considered to be the same type regardless of its underlying size. This removes the restriction found in arrays where the size determines the type.</p><p class="calibre10">For instance, the following variables, <code class="email">months</code> and <code class="email">q1</code>, have the same type of <code class="email">[]string</code> and will compile with no problem:</p><pre class="programlisting">var ( 
    months []string 
    q1 []string 
) 
func print(strs []string){ ... } 
func main() { 
   print(months) 
   print(q1) 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch07/slicetypes.go</p><p class="calibre10">Similar to arrays, slice types may be nested to create multi-dimensional slices, as shown in the following code snippet. Each dimension can independently have its own size and must be initialized individually:</p><pre class="programlisting">var( 
    board [][]int 
    graph [][][][]int 
) 
</pre></div></body></html>
