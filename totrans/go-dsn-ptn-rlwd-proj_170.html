However, unlike the array type, an uninitialized slice has a zero value of <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">nil</em></span>, which means any attempt to access elements of an uninitialized slice will cause a program to panic.</p><p class="calibre10">One of the simplest ways to initialize a slice is with a composite literal value using the following format (similar to an array):</p><p class="calibre10"><span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">&lt;slice_type&gt;{&lt;comma-separated list of element values&gt;}</em></span></p><p class="calibre10">The literal value for a slice is composed of the slice type followed by a set of comma-separated values, enclosed in curly brackets, that are assigned to the elements of the slice. The following code snippet illustrates several slice variables initialized with composite literal values:</p><pre class="programlisting">var ( 
    ids []string = []string{"fe225", "ac144", "3b12c"} 
    vector = []float64{12.4, 44, 126, 2, 11.5}  
    months = []string { 
         "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", 
         "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", 
         "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec", 
    } 
    // slice of map type (maps are covered later) 
    tables = []map[string][]int { 
         { 
               "age":{53, 13, 5, 55, 45, 62, 34, 7}, 
               "pay":{124, 66, 777, 531, 933, 231}, 
         },

    graph  = [][][][]int{ 
         {{{44}, {3, 5}}, {{55, 12, 3}, {22, 4}}}, 
         {{{22, 12, 9, 19}, {7, 9}}, {{43, 0, 44, 12}, {7}}},

</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch07/sliceinit.go</p><p class="calibre10">As mentioned, the composite literal value of a slice is expressed using a similar form as the array. However, the number of elements provided in the literal is not bounded by a fixed size. This implies that the literal can be as large as needed. Under the cover though, Go creates and manages an array of appropriate size to store the values expressed in the literal.</p></div></div></body></html>
