- en: 'Go provides two built-in functions to query the length and capacity attributes
    of a slice. Given a slice, its length and maximum capacity can be queried, using
    the `len` and `cap` functions respectively, as shown in the following example:'

- en: Recall that a slice is a value (not a pointer) that has a nil as its zero-value.
    Therefore, the code is able to query the length (and capacity) of an uninitialized
    slice without causing a panic at runtime.
