By default, a slice has a static length and capacity. Any attempt to access an index beyond that limit will cause a panic. Go makes available the built-in variadic function <code class="email">append</code> to dynamically add new values to a specified slice, growing its lengths and capacity, as necessary. The following code snippet shows how that is done:</p><pre class="programlisting">func main() { 
   months := make([]string, 3, 3) 
   months = append(months, "Jan", "Feb", "March",  
    "Apr", "May", "June") 
   months = append(months, []string{"Jul", "Aug", "Sep"}...) 
   months = append(months, "Oct", "Nov", "Dec") 
   fmt.Println(len(months), cap(months), months) 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch07/slice_append.go</p><p class="calibre10">The previous snippet starts with a slice with a size and capacity of <code class="email">3</code>. The <code class="email">append</code> function is used to dynamically add new values to the slice beyond its initial size and capacity. Internally, <code class="email">append</code> will attempt to fit the appended values within the target slice. If the slice has not been initialized or has an inadequate capacity, append will allocate a new underlying array, to store the values of the updated slice.</p></div></div></body></html>
