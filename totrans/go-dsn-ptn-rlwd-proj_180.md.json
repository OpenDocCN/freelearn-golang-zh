The append function is used to dynamically add new values to the slice beyond its initial size and capacity. Internally, append will attempt to fit the appended values within the target slice. If the slice has not been initialized or has an inadequate capacity, append will allocate a new underlying array, to store the values of the updated slice.\n```"]
