- en: The *key* specifies the type of a value that will be used to index the stored
    elements of the map. Unlike arrays and slices, map keys can be of any type, not
    just `int`. Map keys, however, must be of types that are comparable including
    numeric, string, Boolean, pointers, arrays, struct, and interface types (see [Chapter
    4](part0027_split_000.html#PNV61-9c484ed022e64a0fb0e1aebf8e05d4fd "Chapter 4. Data
    Types")*, Data Types*, for discussion on comparable types).
