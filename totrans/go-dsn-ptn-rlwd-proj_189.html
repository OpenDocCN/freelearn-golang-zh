It is a composite type that serves as a container for other named types known as fields. The following code snippet shows several variables declared as structs:</p><pre class="programlisting">var( 
   empty struct{} 
   car struct{make, model string} 
   currency struct{name, country string; code int} 
   node struct{ 
         edges []string 
         weight int 
   } 
   person struct{ 
         name string 
         address struct{ 
               street string 
               city, state string 
               postal string 
         } 
   } 
) 
</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch07/structtypes.go</p><p class="calibre10">Note that the struct type has the following general format:</p><p class="calibre10"><span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">struct{&lt;field declaration set&gt;}</em></span></p><p class="calibre10">The <code class="email">struct</code> type is constructed by specifying the keyword <code class="email">struct</code> followed by a set of field declarations enclosed within curly brackets. In its most common form, a field is a unique identifier with an assigned type which follows Go's variable declaration conventions as shown in the previous code snippet (<code class="email">struct</code> also support anonymous fields, covered later).</p><p class="calibre10">It is crucial to understand that the type definition for a <code class="email">struct</code> includes all of its declared fields. For instance, the type for the person variable (see earlier code snippet) is the entire set of fields in the declaration <code class="email">struct { name string; address struct { street string; city string; state string; postal string }}</code>. Therefore, any variable or expression requiring that type must repeat that long declaration. We will see later how that is mitigated by using named types for <code class="email">struct</code>.</p></div></body></html>
