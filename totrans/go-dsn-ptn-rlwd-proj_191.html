The fields for an uninitialized struct are assigned their respective zero values. This means an uninitialized struct requires no further allocation and is ready to be used.</p><p class="calibre10">Nevertheless, a struct variable can be explicitly initialized using a composite literal of the following form:</p><p class="calibre10"><span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">&lt;struct_type&gt;{&lt;positional or named field values&gt;}</em></span></p><p class="calibre10">The composite literal value for a struct can be initialized by a set of field values specified by their respective positions. Using this approach, all field values must be provided, to match their respective declared types, as shown in the following snippet:</p><pre class="programlisting">var( 
   currency = struct{ 
         name, country string 
         code int 
   }{ 
         "USD", "United States",  
         840, 
   } 
... 
) 
</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch07/structinit.go</p><p class="calibre10">In the previous struct literal, all field values of the <code class="email">struct</code> are provided, matching their declared field types. Alternatively, the composite literal value of a <code class="email">struct</code> can be specified using a field indices and their associated value. As before, the index (the field name) and its value is separated by a colon, as shown in the following snippet:</p><pre class="programlisting">var( 
   car = struct{make, model string}{make:"Ford", model:"F150"} 
   node = struct{ 
         edges []string 
         weight int 
   }{ 
         edges: []string{"north", "south", "west"}, 
   } 
... 
) 
</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch07/structinit.go</p><p class="calibre10">As you can see, field values of the composite literal can be selectively specified when the index and its value are provided. For instance, in the initialization of the <code class="email">node</code> variable, the <code class="email">edge</code> field is initialized while <code class="email">weight</code> is omitted.</p></div></div></body></html>
