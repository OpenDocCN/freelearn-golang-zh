For instance, having to write <code class="email">struct { name string; address struct { street string; city string; state string; postal string }}</code> to express a struct type, every time it is needed, would not scale, would be error prone, and would make for grumpy Go developers. Luckily, the proper idiom to fix this is to use named types, as illustrated in the following source code snippet:</p><pre class="programlisting">type person struct { 
   name    string 
   address address 
} 
 
type address struct { 
   street      string 
   city, state string 
   postal      string 
} 
 
func makePerson() person { 
   addr := address{ 
         city: "Goville", 
         state: "Go", 
         postal: "12345", 
   } 
   return person{ 
         name: "vladimir vivien", 
         address: addr, 
   } 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">golang.fyi/ch07/structtype_dec.go</p><p class="calibre10">The previous example binds struct type definitions to the identifiers person and address. This allows the struct types to be reused in different contexts without the need to carry around the long form of the type definitions.
