The chapter opened with a coverage of the array type, where readers learned how to declare, initialize, and use array values. Next, readers learned all about the slice type, specifically the declaration, initialization, and practical examples that uses slice index expressions to create new or re-slice existing slices. The chapter covered the map type, which included information on map initialization, access, update, and traversal. Lastly, the chapter provided information about the definition, initialization, and usage of the struct type.</p><p class="calibre10">Needless to say, this is probably one of the longest chapters of the book. However, the information covered here will prove to be invaluable as the book continues to explore new topics. The next chapter will introduce the idea of using Go to support object-like idioms using methods and interfaces.</p></div></body></html>
