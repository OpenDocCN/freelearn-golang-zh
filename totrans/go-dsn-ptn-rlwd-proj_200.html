It has been mentioned that Go was not designed to function as traditional object-oriented language. There are no object or class keywords defined in Go. So then, why are we discussing objects in Go at all? Well, it turns out that Go perfectly supports object idioms and the practice of object-oriented programming without the heavy baggage of classical hierarchies and complex inheritance structures found in other object-oriented languages.</p><p class="calibre10">Let us review some of the primordial features usually attributed to an object-oriented language in the following table.</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1" class="calibre17"><colgroup class="calibre18"><col class="calibre19"/><col class="calibre19"/><col class="calibre19"/></colgroup><tbody class="calibre20"><tr class="calibre21"><td class="calibre22">

<p class="calibre23">Object: A data type that stores states and exposes behavior</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Yes</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">In Go all types can achieve this. There is no special type called a class or object to do this. Any type can receive a set of method to define its behavior, although the <code class="literal">struct</code> type comes the closest to what is commonly called an object in other languages.</p>
</td></tr><tr class="calibre21"><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Composition</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Yes</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Using a type such as a <code class="literal">struct</code> or an <code class="literal">interface</code> (discussed later), it is possible to create objects and express their polymorphic relationships through composition.</p>
</td></tr><tr class="calibre21"><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Subtype via interface</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Yes</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">A type that defines a set of behaviors (methods) that other types may implement. Later you will see how it is used to implement object sub-typing.</p>
</td></tr><tr class="calibre21"><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Modularity and encapsulation</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Yes</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Go supports physical and logical modularity at its core with concepts such packages and an extensible type system, and code element visibility.</p>
</td></tr><tr class="calibre21"><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Type inheritance</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">No</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Go does not support polymorphism through inheritance. A newly declared named type does not inherit all attributes of its underlying type and are treated differently by the type system. As a consequence, it is hard to implement inheritance via type lineage as found in other languages.</p>
</td></tr><tr class="calibre21"><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Classes</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">No</p>
</td><td class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">There is no notion of a class type that serves as the basis for objects in Go. Any data type in Go can be used as an object.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class="calibre10">As the previous table suggests, Go supports the majority of concepts that are usually attributed to object-oriented programming. The remainder of this chapter covers topics and examples showing how to use Go as an object-oriented programming language.</p></div></body></html>
