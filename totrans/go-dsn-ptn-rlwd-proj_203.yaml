    as if they are members of the `plane` type when, in fact, they are coming from
    the types `vehicle` and `engine` respectively. To avoid ambiguity, the name of
    the fields can be qualified as shown here:'

- en: Methods can also be promoted in a similar way. For instance, in the previous
    code we saw the methods `t.start()` and `p.start()` being invoked. However, neither
    type, `truck` nor `plane`, are receivers of a method named `start()`. As shown
    in the program from earlier, the `start()`method is defined for the `engine` type.
    Since the `engine` type is embedded in the types `truck` and `plane`, the `start()`method
    is promoted in scope to these enclosing types and is therefore Â accessible.
