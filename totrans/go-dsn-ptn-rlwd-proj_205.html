The concept of interfaces in Go, similar to other languages, such as Java, is a set of methods that serves as a template to describe behavior. A Go interface, however, is a type specified by the <code class="email">interface{}</code> literal, which is used to list a set of methods that satisfies the interface. The following example shows the <code class="email">shape</code> variable being declared as an interface:</p><pre class="programlisting">var shape interface { 
    area() float64 
    perim() float64 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">In the previous snippet, the <code class="email">shape</code> variable is declared and assigned an unnamed type, <code class="email">interface{area()float64; perim()float64}</code>. Declaring variables with unnamed <code class="email">interface</code> literal types is not really practical. Using idiomatic Go, an <code class="email">interface</code> type is almost always declared as a named <code class="email">type</code>. The previous snippet can be rewritten to use a named interface type, as shown in the following example:</p><pre class="programlisting">type shape interface { 
   area() float64 
   perim() float64 
} 
var s shape 
</pre></div></body></html>
