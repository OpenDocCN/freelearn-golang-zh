["```go\nvar shape interface { \n    area() float64 \n    perim() float64 \n} \n\nshape variable is declared and assigned an unnamed type, interface{area()float64; perim()float64}. Declaring variables with unnamed interface literal types is not really practical. Using idiomatic Go, an interface type is almost always declared as a named type. The previous snippet can be rewritten to use a named interface type, as shown in the following example:\n```", "```go\ntype shape interface { \n   area() float64 \n   perim() float64 \n} \nvar s shape \n\n```"]
