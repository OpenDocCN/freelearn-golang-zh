    interface types at once. This is achieved simply by having the method set of a
    given type intersect with the methods of each `interface` type to be implemented.
    Let us re-implement the previous code to show how this is done. Two new interfaces
    are introduced, `polygon` and `curved`, to better capture and categorize information
    and the behavior of shapes, as shown in the following code snippet:'
