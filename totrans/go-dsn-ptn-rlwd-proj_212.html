The chapter started with coverage of attaching methods to types using receiver parameters. Next the reader was introduced to objects and how to create idiomatic object-based programming in Go. Lastly, the chapter presented a comprehensive overview of the interface type and how it is used to support object semantics in Go. The next chapter takes the reader through one of the most fundamental concepts that has made Go such a sensation among developers: concurrency!</p></div></body></html>
