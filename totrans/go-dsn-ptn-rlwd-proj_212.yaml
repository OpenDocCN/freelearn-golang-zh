- en: 'This chapter attempted to give a broad and, at the same, somewhat comprehensive
    view of several important topics including methods, interfaces, and objects in
    Go. The chapter started with coverage of attaching methods to types using receiver
    parameters. Next the reader was introduced to objects and how to create idiomatic
    object-based programming in Go. Lastly, the chapter presented a comprehensive
    overview of the interface type and how it is used to support object semantics
    in Go. The next chapter takes the reader through one of the most fundamental concepts
    that has made Go such a sensation among developers: concurrency!'
