If you have done concurrent programming in languages such as Java or C/C++, you are likely familiar with the, sometimes brittle, choreography required to ensure running threads can safely access shared memory values to achieve communication and synchronization between threads.</p><p class="calibre10">This is one area where Go diverges from its C lineage. Instead of having concurrent code communicate by using shared memory locations, Go uses channels as a conduit between running goroutines to communicate and share data. The blog post <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Effective Go</em></span> (<a class="calibre1" href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html</a>) has reduced this concept to the following slogan:</p><p class="calibre10"><span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.</em></span></p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note19" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">The concept of channel has its roots in <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">communicating sequential processes</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">CSP</strong></span>), work done by renowned computer scientist C. A. Hoare, to model concurrency using communication primitives. As will be discussed in this section, channels provide the means to synchronize and safely communicate data between running goroutines.</p></div><p class="calibre10">This section discusses the Go channel type and provides insights into its characteristics. Later, you will learn how to use channels to craft concurrent programs.</p></div></body></html>
