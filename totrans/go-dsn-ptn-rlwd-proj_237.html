This chapter covered the major topics to guide readers around the use of concurrency primitives in the Go language. The first section of the chapter outlined the crucial properties of goroutines, including the creation and usage of the <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">go</em></span> statement. Next, the chapter covered the mechanism of Go's runtime scheduler and the notion of channels used for communication between running goroutines. Lastly, users were introduced to several concurrency patterns used to create concurrent programs using goroutines, channels, and the synchronization primitives from the sync package.</p><p class="calibre10">Next, you will be introduced to the standard APIs to do data input and output in Go.</p></div></body></html>
