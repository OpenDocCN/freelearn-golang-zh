- en: Concurrency can be a complex topic in any language. This chapter covered the
    major topics to guide readers around the use of concurrency primitives in the
    Go language. The first section of the chapter outlined the crucial properties
    of goroutines, including the creation and usage of the *go* statement. Next, the
    chapter covered the mechanism of Go's runtime scheduler and the notion of channels
    used for communication between running goroutines. Lastly, users were introduced
    to several concurrency patterns used to create concurrent programs using goroutines,
    channels, and the synchronization primitives from the sync package.
