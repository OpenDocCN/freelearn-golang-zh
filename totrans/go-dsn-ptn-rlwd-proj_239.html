Data resources, such as files, networked connections, or even some in-memory objects, can be modeled as streams of bytes from which data can be <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">read</em></span> or <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">written</em></span> to, as illustrated in the following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00026.jpeg" alt="IO with readers and writers" class="calibre14"/></div><p class="calibre15"> </p><p class="calibre10">The stream of data is represented as a <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">slice of bytes</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">[]byte</strong></span>) that can be accessed for reading or writing. As we will explore in this chapter, the <code class="email">
<span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">io</em></span>
</code> package makes available the <code class="email">io.Reader</code> interface to implement code that <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">reads</em></span> and transfers data from a source into a stream of bytes. Conversely, the <code class="email">io.Writer</code> interface lets implementers create code that reads data from a provided stream of bytes and <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">writes</em></span>Â it as output to a target resource. Both interfaces are used extensively in Go as a standard idiom to express IO operations. This makes it possible to interchange readers and writers of different implementations and contexts with predictable results.</p></div></div></body></html>
