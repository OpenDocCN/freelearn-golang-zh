- en: The `os` package ([https://golang.org/pkg/os/](https://golang.org/pkg/os/))
    exposes the `os.File` type which represents a file handle on the system. The `os.File`
    type implements several IO primitives, including the `io.Reader` and `io.Writer`
    interfaces, which allows file content to be processed using the standard streaming
    IO API.
