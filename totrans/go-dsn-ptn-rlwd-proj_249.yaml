- en: One of the most widely used packages for IO is `fmt` ([https://golang.org/pkg/fmt](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt)).
    It comes with an amalgam of functions designed for formatted input and output.
    The most common usage of the `fmt` package is for writing to standard output and
    reading from standard input. This section also highlights other functions that
    make `fmt` a great tool for IO.
