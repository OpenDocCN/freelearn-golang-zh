This implies that each read and write operation could be negatively impacted by the latency of the underlying OS to handle IO requests. Buffered operations, on the other hand, reduces latency by buffering data in internal memory during IO operations. The <code class="email">bufio</code> package (<a class="calibre1" href="https://golang.org/pkg/bufio">https://golang.org/pkg/bufio</a>/) offers functions for buffered read and write IO operations.</p></div></body></html>
