- en: Most IO operations covered so far have been unbuffered. This implies that each
    read and write operation could be negatively impacted by the latency of the underlying
    OS to handle IO requests. Buffered operations, on the other hand, reduces latency
    by buffering data in internal memory during IO operations. The `bufio` package
    ([https://golang.org/pkg/bufio](https://golang.org/pkg/bufio)/) offers functions
    for buffered read and write IO operations.
