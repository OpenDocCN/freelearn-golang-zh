- en: The previous code uses the `reader.ReadString` method to read a text file using
    the `'\n'` character as the content delimiter. To influence the size of the internal
    buffer, use the constructor function `bufio.NewReaderSize(w io.Reader, n int)`
    to specify the internal buffer size. The `bufio.Reader` type also offers the *Read*,
    *ReadByte*, and *ReadBytes* methods for reading raw bytes from a stream and the
    *ReadRune* method for reading Unicode-encoded characters.
