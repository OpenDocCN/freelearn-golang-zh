- en: This chapter provides a high-level view of Go's data input and output idioms
    and the packages involved in implementing IO primitives. The chapter starts by
    covering the fundamentals of a stream-based IO in Go with the `io.Reader` and
    `io.Writer` interfaces. Readers are walked through the implementation strategies
    and examples for both an `io.Reader` and an `io.Writer`.

- en: The chapter goes on to cover packages, types, and functions that that support
    the streaming IO mechanism including working with files, formatted IO, buffered,
    and in-memory IO. The last portion of the chapter covers encoders and decoders
    that convert data as it is being streamed. In the next chapter, the IO theme is
    carried further when the discussion turns to creating programs that use IO to
    communicate via networking.
