It provides a rich API to handle low-level networking primitives as well as application-level protocols such as HTTP. Each logical component of a network is represented by a Go type including hardware interfaces, networks, packets, addresses, protocols, and connections. Furthermore, each type exposes a multitude of methods giving Go one of the most complete standard libraries for network programming supporting both IPv4 and IPv6.</p><p class="calibre10">Whether creating a client or a server program, Go programmers will need, at a minimum, the network primitives covered in the following sections. These primitives are offered as functions and types to facilitate clients connecting to remote services and servers to handle incoming requests.</p></div></div></body></html>
