- en: The starting point for all networked programs in Go is the *net* package ([https://golang.org/pkg/net](https://golang.org/pkg/net)).
    It provides a rich API to handle low-level networking primitives as well as application-level
    protocols such as HTTP. Each logical component of a network is represented by
    a Go type including hardware interfaces, networks, packets, addresses, protocols,
    and connections. Furthermore, each type exposes a multitude of methods giving
    Go one of the most complete standard libraries for network programming supporting
    both IPv4 and IPv6.

    a minimum, the network primitives covered in the following sections. These primitives
    are offered as functions and types to facilitate clients connecting to remote
    services and servers to handle incoming requests.
