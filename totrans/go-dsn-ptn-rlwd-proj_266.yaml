- en: One of the basic primitives, when doing network programming, is the *address*.
    The types and functions of the `net` package use a string literal to represent
    an address such as `"127.0.0.1"`. The address can also include a service port
    separated by a colon such as `"74.125.21.113:80"`. Functions and methods in the
    `net` package also support string literal representation for IPv6 addresses such
    as `"::1"` or `"[2607:f8b0:4002:c06::65]:80"` for an address with a service port
    of 80.
