- en: The `net.Conn` interface represents a generic connection established between
    two nodes on the network. It implementsÂ `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` interfaces
    which allow connected nodes to exchange data using streaming IO primitives. The
    `net` package offers network protocol-specific implementations of the `net.Conn`
    interface such as *IPConn*, *UDPConn*, and *TCPConn*. Each implementation exposes
    additional methods specific to its respective network and protocol. However, as
    we will see in this chapter, the default method set defined in net.Conn is adequate
    for most uses.
