    which the service will use to listen for incoming requests from the network. This
    is done by invoking the `net.Listen` function which has the following signature:'

    valid values of `"tcp"`, `"tcp4"`, `"tcp6"`, `"unix"`, or `"unixpacket"`.

- en: The second parameter is the local host address for the service. The local address
    can be specified without an IP address such as `":4040"`. Omitting the IP address
    of the host means that the service is bound to all network card interfaces installed
    on the host. As an alternative, the service can be bound to a specific network
    hardware interface on the host by specifying its IP address on the network, that
    is, `"10.20.130.240:4040"`.

- en: A successful call to the `net.Listen` function returns a value of the `net.Listener`
    type (or a non-nil error if it fails). The `net.Listener` interface exposes methods
    used to manage the life cycle of incoming client connections. Depending on the
    value of the `network` parameter (`"tcp"`, `"tcp4"`, `"tcp6"`, and so on.), `net.Listen`
    will return either a `net.TCPListener` or `net.UnixListener` *,* both of which
    are concrete implementations of the `net.Listener` interface.
