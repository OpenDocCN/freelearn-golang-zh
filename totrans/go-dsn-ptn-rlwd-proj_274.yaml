- en: Due to its importance and ubiquity, HTTP is one of a handful of protocols directly
    implemented in Go. The `net/http` package ([https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/))
    provides code to implement both HTTP clients and HTTP servers. This section explores
    the fundamentals of creating HTTP clients and servers using the `net/http` package.
    Later, we will return our attention back to building versions of our currency
    service using HTTP.
