It starts with a walkthrough of Go's <code class="email">net</code> package including the <code class="email">net.Conn</code> type to create a connection between network nodes, the <code class="email">net.Dial</code> function to connect to a remote service, and the <code class="email">net.Listen</code> function to handle incoming connections from a client. The chapter continues to cover different implementations of clients and server programs and shows the implications of creating custom protocols directly over raw TCP versus using an existing protocol such as HTTP with JSON data format.</p><p class="calibre10">The next chapter takes a different direction. It explores the packages, types, functions, and tools that are available in Go to facilitate source code testing.</p></div></body></html>
