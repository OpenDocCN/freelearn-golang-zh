- en: This chapter condenses several important notions about creating networked services
    in Go. It starts with a walkthrough of Go's `net` package including the `net.Conn`
    type to create a connection between network nodes, the `net.Dial` function to
    connect to a remote service, and the `net.Listen` function to handle incoming
    connections from a client. The chapter continues to cover different implementations
    of clients and server programs and shows the implications of creating custom protocols
    directly over raw TCP versus using an existing protocol such as HTTP with JSON
    data format.

    functions, and tools that are available in Go to facilitate source code testing.
