- en: The test command uses the import path standard (see [Chapter 6](part0042_split_000.html#181NK2-9c484ed022e64a0fb0e1aebf8e05d4fd
    "Chapter 6. Go Packages and Programs"), *Go Packages and Programs*) to specify
    which packages to test. Within a specified package, the test tool will compile
    all files with the `*_test.go` name pattern. For instance, assuming that we have
    a project that has a simple implementation of a mathematical vector type in a
    file called `vec.go`, a sensible name for its test file would be `vec_test.go`.
