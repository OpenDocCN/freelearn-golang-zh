    being tested. This is because there is no need to separate tests files, as they
    are excluded from the compiled program binary. The following shows the directory
    layout for a typical Go package, in this instance the `fmt` package from the standard
    library. It shows all of the test files for the package in the same directory
    as the regular source code:'

- en: Besides having a simpler project structure, keeping the files together gives
    test functions full visibility of the package being tested. This facilitates access
    to and verification of package elements that would otherwise be opaque to testing
    code. When your functions are placed in a separate package from the code to be
    tested, they lose access to non-exported elements of the code.
