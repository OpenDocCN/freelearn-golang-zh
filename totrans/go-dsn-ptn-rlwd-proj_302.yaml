- en: Before dissecting the benchmark result, let us understand the previously issued
    command. The `go test -bench=.` command first executes all the test functions
    in the package followed by all the benchmark functions (you can verify this by
    adding the verbose flag `-v` to the command).

    used to select the benchmark functions that get executed. The `-bench=.` flag
    matches the name of all benchmark functions, as shown in the previous example.
    The following, however, only runs benchmark functions that contain the pattern
    `"VectorA"` in their names. This includes the `BenchmarkVectroAngle()` and `BenchmarkVectorAngle()`Â functions:'
