    of metrics, as shown in the following:'

- en: The first column contains the names of the benchmark functions, with each name
    suffixed with a number that reflects the value of *GOMAXPROCS*, which can be set
    at test time using the `-cpu` flag (relevant for running benchmarks in parallel).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next column displays the number of iterations for each benchmark loop. For
    instance, in the previous report, the first two benchmark functions looped 2 million
    times, while the final benchmark function iterated 5 million times. The last column
    of the report shows the average time it takes to execute the tested function.
    For instance, the 5 million calls to the `Scale` method executed in benchmark
    function `BenchmarkVectorScale` took on average 266 nanoseconds to complete.
