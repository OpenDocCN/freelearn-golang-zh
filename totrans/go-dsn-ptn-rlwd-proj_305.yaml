- en: 'By default, the test framework gradually adjusts `N` to be large enough to
    arrive at stable and meaningful metrics over a period of *one second*. You cannot
    change `N` directly. However, you can use flag `-benchtime` to specify a benchmark
    run time and thus influence the number of iterations during a benchmark. For instance,
    the following runs the benchmark for a period of `5` seconds:'

- en: Notice that even though there is a drastic jump in the number iterations (factor
    of five or more) for each benchmark, the average performance time for each benchmark
    function remains reasonably consistent. This information provides valuable insight
    into the performance of your code. It is a great way to observe the impact of
    code or load changes on performance, as discussed in the following section.
