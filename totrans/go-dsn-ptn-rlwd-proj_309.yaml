    of software. Since the *Gang Of Four* (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson
    and John Vlissides) wrote the book *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
    Software* in 1994 with examples in C++ and Smalltalk, the twenty-three classic
    patterns have been re-implemented in most of major languages of today and they
    have been used in almost every project you know about.'
