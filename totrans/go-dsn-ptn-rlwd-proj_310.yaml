    Storage spaces have been increased dramatically, RAM has suffered a substantial
    growth, and CPU's are... well... simply faster. Have they grown as much as storage
    and RAM memory? Not really, CPU industry has reached a limit in the speed that
    their CPU's can deliver, mainly because they have become so fast that they cannot
    get enough power to work while they dissipate enough heat. The CPU manufacturers
    are now shipping more cores on each computer. This situation crashes against the
    background of many systems programming languages that weren't designed for multi-processor
    CPUs or large distributed systems that act as a unique machine. In Google, they
    realized that this was becoming more than an issue while they were struggling
    to develop distributed applications in languages like Java or C++ that weren't
    designed with concurrency in mind.

    maintain and with aÂ lot of room for bad practices. While our computers had more
    cores and were faster, we were not faster when developing our code neither our
    distributed applications. This was Go's target.

    Lance Taylor. The team started their journey to open source the project in 2009
    and in March 2012 they reached a version 1.0 after more than fifty releases.
