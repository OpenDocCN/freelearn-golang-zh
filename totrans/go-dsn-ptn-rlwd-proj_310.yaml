  zh: 一点历史背景
- en: On the last 20 years, we have lived an incredible growth in computer science.
    Storage spaces have been increased dramatically, RAM has suffered a substantial
    growth, and CPU's are... well... simply faster. Have they grown as much as storage
    and RAM memory? Not really, CPU industry has reached a limit in the speed that
    their CPU's can deliver, mainly because they have become so fast that they cannot
    get enough power to work while they dissipate enough heat. The CPU manufacturers
    are now shipping more cores on each computer. This situation crashes against the
    background of many systems programming languages that weren't designed for multi-processor
    CPUs or large distributed systems that act as a unique machine. In Google, they
    realized that this was becoming more than an issue while they were struggling
    to develop distributed applications in languages like Java or C++ that weren't
    designed with concurrency in mind.

  zh: 在过去的20年里，计算机科学经历了令人难以置信的增长。存储空间大幅增加，RAM经历了实质性的增长，CPU...嗯...简单地说就是更快。它们的增长是否与存储和RAM一样大？实际上并没有，CPU行业已经达到了它们的CPU可以提供速度的极限，主要是因为它们变得如此之快，以至于在散发热量的同时无法获得足够的工作功率。CPU制造商现在在每个计算机上提供更多的核心。这种情况与许多系统编程语言的设计背景相冲突，这些语言并没有为多处理器CPU或作为单一机器运作的大规模分布式系统设计。在谷歌，他们意识到，当他们努力在像Java或C++这样的语言中开发分布式应用时，这已经不仅仅是一个问题。
- en: At the same time, our programs were bigger, more complex, more difficult to
    maintain and with a lot of room for bad practices. While our computers had more
    cores and were faster, we were not faster when developing our code neither our
    distributed applications. This was Go's target.

  zh: 同时，我们的程序变得更大、更复杂、更难以维护，并且存在许多不良实践的空间。尽管我们的计算机拥有更多的核心和更快的速度，但在开发代码和分布式应用时，我们并没有变得更快。这是Go的目标。
