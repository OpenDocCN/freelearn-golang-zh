- en: To install Go in Windows, you will need administrator privileges. Open your
    favorite browser and navigate to `https://golang.org` . Once there click the **Download
    Go** button and select **Microsoft Windows** distribution. A `*.msi` file will
    start downloading.

    you to accept the **End User License Agreement** (**EULA**) and select a target
    folder for your installation. We will continue with the default path that in my
    case was `C:\Go`.

- en: Once the installation is finished you will have to add the **binary Go** folder,
    located in `C:\Go\bin` to your Path. For this, you must go to Control Panel and
    select **System** option. Once in System, select the **Advanced** tab and click
    the **Environment variables** button. Here you'll find a window with variables
    for your current user and system variables. In system variables, you'll find the
    **Path** variable. Click it and click the **Edit** button to open a text box.
    You can add your path by adding `;C:\Go/bin` at the end of the current line (note
    the semicolon at the beginning of the path). In recent Windows versions (Windows
    10) you will have a manager to add variables easily.
