- en: GOPATH has a very important role in your working environment while developing
    Go software. When you import a library in your code it will search for this library
    in your `$GOPATH/src`. The same when you install some Go apps, binaries will be
    stored in `$GOPATH/bin`.

    folder. For example, I store my projects in GitHub and my username is *Sayden*
    so, for a project called **minimal-mesos-go-framework** I will have this folder
    structure likeÂ `$GOPATH/src/github.com/sayden/minimal-mesos-go-framework` which
    reflects the URI where this repo is stored at GitHub:'
