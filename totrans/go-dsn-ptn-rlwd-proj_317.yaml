- en: An **IDE** (**Integrated Development Environment**) is basically a user interface
    to help developers, code their programs by providing a set of tools to speed up
    common tasks during development process like compiling, building, or managing
    dependencies. The IDEs are powerful tools that take some time to master and the
    purpose of this book is not to explain them (an IDE like Eclipse has its own books).

    to Go developmentÂ **LiteIDE** and **Intellij Gogland**. LiteIDE is not the most
    powerful though but Intellij has put lots of efforts to make Gogland a very nice
    editor with completion, debugging, refactoring, testing, visual coverage, inspections,

- en: The IntelliJ Idea and Atom IDEs, for the time of this writing, has the support
    for debugging using a plugin called **Delve**. The IntelliJ Idea is bundled with
    the official Go plugin. In Atom you'll have to download a plugin called **Go-plus**
    and a debugger that you can find searching the word `Delve`.
