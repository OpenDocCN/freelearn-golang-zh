All programming languages have types related with numbers (to store integers, negative numbers, or floating point for example) with characters (to store a single character) with strings (to store complete words) andÂ so on. Go language has the common types found in most programming languages:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">bool</code> keyword is for Boolean type which represents a <code class="email">True</code> or <code class="email">False</code> state.</li><li class="listitem">Many numeric types being the most common:<div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist1"><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">int</code> is a signed integer type, so int type represents a number from -2147483648 to 2147483647 in 32 bits machines</li><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">byte</code> type represents a number from 0 to 255.</li><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">float32</code> and <code class="email">float64</code> types are the set of all IEEE-754 64/-bit floating-point numbers respectively.</li><li class="listitem">You also have <code class="email">signed int</code> type like <code class="email">rune</code> which is an alias of <code class="email">int32</code> type, a number that goes from -2147483648 to 2147483647 and <code class="email">complex64</code> and <code class="email">complex128</code> which are the set of all complex numbers with <code class="email">float32</code>/ <code class="email">float64</code> real and imaginary parts like <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">2.0i</em></span>.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre29">
</p></li><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">string</code> keyword for string type represents an array of characters enclosed in quotes like <code class="email">"golang"</code> or <code class="email">"computer"</code>.</li><li class="listitem">An <code class="email">array</code> that is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type and a fixed size (more about arrays later in this chapter). A list of numbers or lists of words with a fixed size is considered arrays.</li><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">slice</code> type is a segment of an underlying array (more about this later in this chapter). This type is a bit confusing at the beginning because it seems like an array but we will see that actually, they are more powerful.</li><li class="listitem">The structures that are the objects that are composed of another objects or types.</li><li class="listitem">The pointers (more about this later in this chapter)are like directions in the memory of our program (yes, like mailboxes that you don't know what's inside).</li><li class="listitem">The functions are interesting (more about this later in this chapter). You can also define functions as variables and pass them to other functions (yes, a function that uses a function, did you like Inception movie?).</li><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">interface</code> is incredibly important for the language as they provide many encapsulation and abstraction functionalities that we'll need often. We'll use interfaces extensively during the book and they are presented in greater detail later.</li><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">map</code> types are unordered key-value structures. So for a given key, you have an associated value.</li><li class="listitem">The channels are the communication primitive in Go for concurrency programs. We'll look on channels with more detail on Chapter 8, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Dealing with Go's CSP concurrency</em></span>.</li></ul></div></div></body></html>
