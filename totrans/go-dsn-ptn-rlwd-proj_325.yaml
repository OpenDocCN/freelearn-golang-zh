- en: A function is a small portion of code that surrounds some action you want to
    perform and returns one or more values (or nothing). They are the main tool for
    developer to maintain structure, encapsulation, and code readability but also
    allow an experienced programmer to develop proper unit tests against his or her
    functions.

    simpler functions are also easier to maintain, test and debug. There is also a
    very good advice in computer science world that says: *A function must do just
    one thing, but it must do it damn well*.'
