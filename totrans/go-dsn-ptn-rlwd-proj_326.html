Functions in Go has the following composition:</p><pre class="programlisting">func [function_name] (param1 type, param2 type...) (returned type1, returned type2...) { 
    //Function body 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">Following the previous definition, we could have the following example:</p><pre class="programlisting">func hello(message string) error { 
    fmt.Printf("Hello %s\n", message) 
    return nil 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">Functions can call other functions. For example, in our previous <code class="email">hello</code> function, we are receiving a message argument of type string and we are calling a different function <code class="email">fmt.Printf("Hello %s\n", message)</code> with our argument as parameter. Functions can also be used as parameters when calling other functions or be returned.</p><p class="calibre10">It is very important to choose a good name for your function so that it is very clear what it is about without writing too many comments over it. This can look a bit trivial but choosing a good name is not so easy. A short name must show what the function does and let the reader imagine what error is it handling or if it's doing any kind of logging. Within your function, you want to do everything that a particular behavior need but also to control expected errors and wrapping them properly.</p><p class="calibre10">So, to write a function is more than simply throw a couple of lines that does what you need, that's why it is important to write a unit test, make them small and concise.</p></div></div></body></html>
