This is useful when you want to return a function from another function that doesn't need a context or when you want to pass a function to a different function. For example, we will create a function that accepts one number and returns a function that accepts a second number that it adds it to the first one. The second function does not have a declarative name (as we have assigned it to a variable) that is why it is said to be anonymous:</p><pre class="programlisting">func main(){ 
    add := func(m int){ 
         return m+1 
} 
 
    result := add(6) 
 
    //1 + 6 must print 7 
    println(result) 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">The <code class="email">add</code> variable points to an anonymous function that adds one to the specified parameter. As you can see, it can be used only for the scope its parent function <code class="email">main</code> and cannot be called from anywhere else.</p><p class="calibre10">Anonymous functions are really powerful tools that we will use extensively on design patterns.</p></div></div></body></html>
