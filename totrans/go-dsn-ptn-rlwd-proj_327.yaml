- en: 'An anonymous function is a function without a name. This is useful when you
    want to return a function from another function that doesn''t need a context or
    when you want to pass a function to a different function. For example, we will
    create a function that accepts one number and returns a function that accepts
    a second number that it adds it to the first one. The second function does not
    have a declarative name (as we have assigned it to a variable) that is why it
    is said to be anonymous:'

    parameter. As you can see, it can be used only for the scope its parent function
    `main` and cannot be called from anywhere else.
