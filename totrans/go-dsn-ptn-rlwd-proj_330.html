This means that its number of arguments can vary. What this does is to provide an array to the scope of the function that contains the arguments that the function was called with. This is convenient if you don't want to force the user to provideÂ an array when using this function. For example:</p><pre class="programlisting">func main() { 
    fmt.Printf("%d\n", sum(1,2,3)) 
    fmt.Printf("%d\n", sum(4,5,6,7,8)) 
} 
 
func sum(args ...int) (result int) { 
    for _, v := range args { 
        result += v 
    } 
    return 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">In this example, we have a <code class="email">sum</code> function that will return the sum of all its arguments but take a closer look at the <code class="email">main</code> function where we call <code class="email">sum</code>. As you can see now, first we call <code class="email">sum</code> with three arguments and then with five arguments. For <code class="email">sum</code> functions, it doesn't matter how many arguments you pass as it treats its arguments as an array all in all. So on our <code class="email">sum</code> definition, we simply iterate over the array to add each number to the <code class="email">result</code> integer.</p><div class="book" title="Naming returned types"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01" class="calibre1"/>Naming returned types</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">Have you realized that we have given a name to the returned type? Usually, our declaration would be written as <code class="email">func sum(args int) int</code> but you can also name the variable that you'll use within the function as a return value. Naming the variable in the return type would also zero-value it (in this case, an <code class="email">int</code> will be initialized as zero). At the end, you just need to return the function (without value) and it will take the respective variable from the scope as returned value. This also makes easier to follow the mutation that the returning variable is suffering as well as to ensure that you aren't returning a mutated argument.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
