- en: Arrays are one of the most widely used types of computer programming. They are
    lists of other types that you can access by using their position on the list.
    The only downside of an array is that its size cannot be modified. Slices allow
    the use of arrays with variable size. The `maps` type will let us have a dictionary
    like structures in Go. Let's see how each work.
