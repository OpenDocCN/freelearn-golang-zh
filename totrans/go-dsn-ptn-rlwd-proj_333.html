This is achieved, thanks to the underlying structure of a slice that is an array. So, like arrays, you have to specify the type of the slice and its size. So, use the following line to create a slice:</p><pre class="programlisting">mySlice := make([]int, 10) 
</pre><p class="calibre10">This command has created an underlying array of ten elements. If we need to change the size of the slice by, for example, adding a new number, we would append the number to the slice:</p><pre class="programlisting">mySlice := append(mySlice, 5) 
</pre><p class="calibre10">The syntax of append is of the form ([array to append an item to], [item to append]) and returns the new slice, it does not modify the actual slice. This is also true to delete an item. For example, let's delete the first item of the array as following:</p><pre class="programlisting">mySlice := mySlice[1:] 
</pre><p class="calibre10">Yes, like in arrays. But what about deleting the second item? We use the same syntax:</p><pre class="programlisting">mySlice = append(mySlice[:1], mySlice[2:]...) 
</pre><p class="calibre10">We take all elements from zero index (included) to the first index (not included) and each element from the second index (included) to the end of the array, effectively deleting the value at the second position in the slice (index 1 as we start counting with 0). As you can see, we use the undetermined arguments syntax as the second parameter.</p></div></div></body></html>
