    is achieved, thanks to the underlying structure of a slice that is an array. So,
    like arrays, you have to specify the type of the slice and its size. So, use the
    following line to create a slice:'

    append]) and returns the new slice, it does not modify the actual slice. This
    is also true to delete an item. For example, let''s delete the first item of the
    array as following:'

- en: We take all elements from zero index (included) to the first index (not included)
    and each element from the second index (included) to the end of the array, effectively
    deleting the value at the second position in the slice (index 1 as we start counting
    with 0). As you can see, we use the undetermined arguments syntax as the second
    parameter.
