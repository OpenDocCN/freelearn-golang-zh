- en: Visibility is the attribute of a function or a variable to be visible to different
    parts of the program. So a variable can be used only in the function that is declared,
    in the entire package or in the entire program.

- en: Here, `Hello_world` is a global function (a function that is visible across
    the entire source code and to third party users of your code). So, if our package
    is called `hello`, we could call this function from outside of this package by
    using `hello.Hello_world()` method.

- en: As you can see, we are in the `different_package` package. We have to import
    the package we want to use with the keyword import. The route then is the path
    within your `$GOPATH/src` that contains the package we are looking for. This path
    conveniently matches the URL of a GitHub account or any other **Concurrent Versions
    System**(**CVS**) repository.
