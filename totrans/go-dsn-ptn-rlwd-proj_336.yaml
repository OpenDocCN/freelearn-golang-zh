- en: Zero-initialization is important when programming in Go because you won't be
    able to return a `nil` value if you have to return an `int` type or a `struct`.
    Keep this in mind, for example, in functions where you have to return a `bool`
    value. Imagine that you want to know if a number is divisible by a different number
    but you pass `0` (zero) as the divisor.

    by zero is an error, it''s not that 10 isn''t divisible by zero but that a number
    cannot be divided by zero by definition. Zero-initialization is making things
    awkward in this situation. So, how can we solve this error? Consider the following
    code:'
