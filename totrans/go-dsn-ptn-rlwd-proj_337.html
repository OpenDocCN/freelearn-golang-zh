But they are one of the main tools to achieve high-performance code in non-garbage-collected languages. Fortunately for us, Go's pointers have achieved the best of both worlds by providing high-performance pointers with garbage-collector capabilities and easiness.</p><p class="calibre10">On the other side for its detractors, Go lacks inheritance in favor of composition. Instead of talking about the objects that <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">are</em></span> in Go, your objects <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">have other </em></span>. So, instead of having a <code class="email">car</code> structure that inherits the class <code class="email">vehicle</code> (a car is a vehicle), you could have a <code class="email">vehicle</code> structure that contains a <code class="email">car</code> structure within.</p></div></body></html>
