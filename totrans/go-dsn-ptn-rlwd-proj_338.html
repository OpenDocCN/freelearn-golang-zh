Why are they good?</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">Pointers are hated, loved, and very useful at the same time. To understand what a pointer is can be difficult so let's try with a real world explanation. As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, a pointer is a like a mailbox. Imagine a bunch of mailboxes in a building; all of them have the same size and shape but each refers to a different house within the building. Just because all mailboxes are the same size does not mean that each house will have the same size. We could even have a couple of houses joined, a house that was there but now has a license of commerce, or a house that is completely empty. So the pointers are the mailboxes, all of them of the same size and that refer to a house. The building is our memory and the houses are the types our pointers refer to and the memory they allocate. If you want to receive something in your house, it's far easier to simply send the address of your house (to send the pointer) instead of sending the entire house so that your package is deposited inside. But they have some drawbacks as if you send your address and your house (variable it refers to) disappears after sending, or its type owner change--you'll be in trouble.</p><p class="calibre10">How is this useful? Imagine that somehow you have 4 GB of data in a variable and you need to pass it to a different function. Without a pointer, the entire variable is cloned to the scope of the function that is going to use it. So, you'll have 8 GB of memory occupied by using this variable twice that, hopefully, the second function isn't going to use in a different function again to raise this number even more.</p><p class="calibre10">You could use a pointer to pass a very small reference to this chunk to the first function so that just the small reference is cloned and you can keep your memory usage low.</p><p class="calibre10">While this isn't the most academic nor exact explanation, it gives a good view of what a pointer is without explaining what a stack or a heap is or how they work in x86 architectures.</p><p class="calibre10">Pointers in Go are very limited compared with C or C++ pointers. You can't use pointer arithmetic nor can you create a pointer to reference an exact position in the stack.</p><p class="calibre10">Pointers in Go can be declared like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">number := 5 
</pre><p class="calibre10">Here <code class="email">number := 5</code> code represents our 4 GB variable and <code class="email">pointer_to_number</code> contains the reference (represented by an ampersand) to this variable. It's the direction to the variable (the one that you put in the mailbox of this <code class="email">house/type/variable</code>). Let's print the variable <code class="email">pointer_to_number</code> , which is a simple variable:</p><pre class="programlisting">println(pointer_to_number) 
0x005651FA 
</pre><p class="calibre10">What's that number? Well, the direction to our variable in memory. And how can I print the actual value of the house? Well, with an asterisk (<code class="email">*)</code> we tell the compiler to take the value that the pointer is referencing, which is our 4 GB variable.</p><pre class="programlisting"> println(*pointer_to_number) 
5 
</pre></div></div></body></html>
