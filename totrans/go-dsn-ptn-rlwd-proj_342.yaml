- en: When you write the first lines of some library, it's difficult to introduce
    many bugs. But once the source code gets bigger and bigger, it becomes easier
    to break things. The team grows and now many people are writing the same source
    code, new functionality is added on top of the code that you wrote at the beginning.
    And code stopped working by some modification in some function that now nobody
    can track down.

    completely solve it, it's not a holy grail). When you write unit tests during
    your development process, you can check whether some new feature is breaking something
    older or whether your current new feature is achieving everything expected in
    the requirements.

    quite easily. It is also very convenient to check the portions of your code without
    the need to write an entire main application that uses it.
