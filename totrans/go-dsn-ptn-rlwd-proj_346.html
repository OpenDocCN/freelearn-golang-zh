Instead of using the <code class="email">git clone</code> command, you can use Go get to receive a series of added benefits. Let's write an example using CoreOS's <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">ETCD </strong></span>project which is a famous distributed key-value store.</p><p class="calibre10">CoreOS's ETCD is hosted on GitHub at <a class="calibre1" href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd.git">
https://github.com/coreos/etcd.git</a>. To download this project source code using the Go get tool, we must type in the Terminal it's resulting import path that it will have in our GOPATH:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">$ go get github.com/coreos/etcd</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">Note that we have just typed the most relevant information so that Go get figures out the rest. You'll get some output, depending on the state of the project, but after, while, it will disappear. But what did happen?</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Go get has created a folder in <code class="email">$GOPATH/src/github.com/coreos</code>.</li><li class="listitem">It has cloned the project in that location, so now the source code of ETCD is available at <code class="email">$GOPATH/src/github.com/coreos/etcd</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Go get has cloned any repository that ETCD could need.</li><li class="listitem">It has tried to install the project if it is not a library. This means, it has generated a binary file of ETCD and has put it in <code class="email">$GOPATH/bin</code> folder.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">By simply typing the <code class="email">go get [project]</code> command, you'll get all that material from a project in your system. Then in your Go apps, you can just use any library by importing the path within the source. So for the ETCD project, it will be:</p><pre class="programlisting">import "github.com/coreos/etcd" 
</pre><p class="calibre10">It's very important that you get familiar with the use of the Go get tool and stop using <code class="email">git clone</code> when you want a project from a Git repository. This will save you some headaches when trying to import a project that isn't contained within your GOPATH.</p></div></body></html>
