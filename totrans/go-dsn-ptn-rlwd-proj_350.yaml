    linter is available on [https://github.com/golang/lint](https://github.com/golang/lint) for
    installation (it doesn''t come bundled with the compiler). It is very easy to
    use and is integrated some IDEs to be run when you save a source code file (Atom
    or Sublime Text, for example). Do you remember the implicit/explicit code that
    we run when talking about variables? Let''s lint it:'

    from the code and you don't need to declare its type. What about the `Train` type
