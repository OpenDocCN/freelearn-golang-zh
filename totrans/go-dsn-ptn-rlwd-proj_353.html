Sometimes you remember your packages so well that you don't need to search much to remember their API but it's more difficult to remember the project they belong to when doing the import. The <code class="email">goimport</code> command helps you by searching your <code class="email">$GOPATH</code> for occurrences of a package that you could be using to provide you with the project <code class="email">import</code> line automatically. This is very useful if you configure your IDE to run <code class="email">goimport</code> on save so that all used packages in the source file are imported automatically if you used them. It also works the other way around--if you delete the function you were using from a package and the package isn't being used anymore, it will remove the <code class="email">import</code> line.</p></div></div></body></html>
