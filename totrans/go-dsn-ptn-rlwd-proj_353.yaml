- en: The `goimport` tool is a must have in Go. Sometimes you remember your packages
    so well that you don't need to search much to remember their API but it's more
    difficult to remember the project they belong to when doing the import. The `goimport`
    command helps you by searching your `$GOPATH` for occurrences of a package that
    you could be using to provide you with the project `import` line automatically.
    This is very useful if you configure your IDE to run `goimport` on save so that
    all used packages in the source file are imported automatically if you used them.
    It also works the other way around--if you delete the function you were using
    from a package and the package isn't being used anymore, it will remove the `import`
    line.
