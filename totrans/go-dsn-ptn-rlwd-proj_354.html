This introduces a small problem when working with GitHub projects. We are used to forking a project, cloning our fork and start working before committing the pull-request to the original project. Wrong!</p><p class="calibre10">When you fork a project, you create a new repository on GitHub within your username. If you clone this repository and start working with it, all new import references in the project will point to your repository instead of the original! Imagine the following case in the original repository:</p><pre class="programlisting">package main 
import "github.com/original/a_library" 
[some code] 
</pre><p class="calibre10">Then, you make a fork and add a subfolder with a library called <code class="email">a_library/my_library</code> that you want to use from the main package. The result is going to be the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">package main 
import ( 
    "github.com/original/a_library" 
    "github.com/myaccount/a_library/my_library" 
) 
</pre><p class="calibre10">Now if you commit this line, the original repository that contains the code you have pushed will download this code anyways from your account again and it will use the references downloaded! Not the ones contained in the project!</p><p class="calibre10">So, the solution to this is simply to replace the <code class="email">git clone</code>Â command with a <code class="email">go get</code> pointing to the original library:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">$ go get github.com/original/a_library</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/original/a_library</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">$ git remote add my_origin https://github.com/myaccount/a_libbrary</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">With this modification, you can work normally in the original code without fear as the references will stay correct. Once you are done you just have to commit and push to your remote.</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">$ git push my_origin my_brach</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">This way, you can now access the GitHub web user interface and open the pull request without polluting the actual original code with references to your account.</p></div></body></html>
