- en: After this first chapter, you must be familiar with the syntax of Go and some
    of the command-line tools that come bundled with the compiler. We have left apart
    concurrency capabilities for a later chapter as they are large and pretty complex
    to grasp at the beginning so that the reader learns the syntax of the language
    first, becomes familiar and confident with it, and then they can jump to understandingÂ **Communicating
    Sequential Processes** (**CSP**) concurrency patterns and distributed applications.
    The next steps are to start with the creational design patterns.
