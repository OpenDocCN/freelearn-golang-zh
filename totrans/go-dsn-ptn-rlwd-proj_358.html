As the name implies, it will provide you with a single instance of an object, and guarantee that there are no duplicates.</p><p class="calibre10">At the first call to use the instance, it is created and then reused between all the parts in the application that need to use that particular behavior.</p><p class="calibre10">You'll use the Singleton pattern in many different situations. For example:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">When you want to use the same connection to a database to make every query</li><li class="listitem">When you open a <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Secure Shell</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">SSH</strong></span>) connection to a server to do a few tasks, and don't want to reopen the connection for each task</li><li class="listitem">If you need to limit the access to some variable or space, you use a Singleton as the door to this variable (we'll see in the following chapters that this is more achievable in Go using channels anyway)</li><li class="listitem">If you need to limit the number of calls to some places, you create a Singleton instance to make the calls in the accepted window</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">The possibilities are endless, and we have just mentioned some of them.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
