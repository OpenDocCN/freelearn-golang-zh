  zh: 示例 - 一个唯一的计数器
- en: As an example of an object of which we must ensure that there is only one instance,
    we will write a counter that holds the number of times it has been called during
    program execution. It shouldn't matter how many instances we have of the counter,
    all of them must *count* the same value and it must be consistent between the
    instances.
  id: totrans-1
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 作为必须确保只有一个实例的对象的例子，我们将编写一个计数器，它记录在程序执行期间被调用的次数。计数器的实例数量多少并不重要，所有实例都必须*计数*相同的值，并且实例之间必须保持一致。
