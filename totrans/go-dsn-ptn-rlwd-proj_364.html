Just keep in mind that the Singleton pattern will give you the power to have a unique instance of some struct in your application and that no package can create any clone of this struct.</p><p class="calibre10">With Singleton, you are also hiding the complexity of creating the object, in case it requires some computation, and the pitfall of creating it every time you need an instance of it if all of them are similar. All this code writing, checking if the variable already exists, and storage, are encapsulated in the singleton and you won't need to repeat it everywhere if you use a global variable.</p><p class="calibre10">Here we are learning the classic singleton implementation for single threaded context. We will see a concurrent singleton implementation when we reach the chapters about concurrency because this implementation is not thread safe!</p></div></div></div></body></html>
