- en: Talking about **Creational** design patterns, it looks pretty semantic to have
    a **Builder** design pattern. The Builder pattern helps us construct complex objects
    without directly instantiating their struct, or writing the logic they require.
    Imagine an object that could have dozens of fields that are more complex structs
    themselves. Now imagine that you have many objects with these characteristics,
    and you could have more. We don't want to write the logic to create all these
    objects in the package that just needs to use the objects.
