You could also have an object that is composed of many objects, something that's really idiomatic in Go, as it doesn't support inheritance.</p><p class="calibre10">At the same time, you could be using the same technique to create many types of objects. For example, you'll use almost the same technique to build a car as you would build a bus, except that they'll be of different sizes and number of seats, so why don't we reuse the construction process? This is where the Builder pattern comes to the rescue.</p></div></div></body></html>
