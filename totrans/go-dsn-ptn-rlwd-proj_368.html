Continuing with our example of the car, we'll create a vehicle Builder. The process (widely described as the algorithm) of creating a vehicle (the product) is more or less the same for every kind of vehicle--choose vehicle type, assemble the structure, place the wheels, and place the seats. If you think about it, you could build a car and a motorbike (two Builders) with this description, so we are reusing the description to create cars in manufacturing. The director is represented by the <code class="email">ManufacturingDirector</code> type in our example.</p></div></div></body></html>
