- en: The Builder design pattern has been commonly described as the relationship between
    a director, a few Builders, and the product they build. Continuing with our example
    of the car, we'll create a vehicle Builder. The process (widely described as the
    algorithm) of creating a vehicle (the product) is more or less the same for every
    kind of vehicle--choose vehicle type, assemble the structure, place the wheels,
    and place the seats. If you think about it, you could build a car and a motorbike
    (two Builders) with this description, so we are reusing the description to create
    cars in manufacturing. The director is represented by the `ManufacturingDirector`
    type in our example.
