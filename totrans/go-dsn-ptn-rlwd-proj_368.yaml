- en: The Builder design pattern has been commonly described as the relationship between
    a director, a few Builders, and the product they build. Continuing with our example
    of the car, we'll create a vehicle Builder. The process (widely described as the
    algorithm) of creating a vehicle (the product) is more or less the same for every
    kind of vehicle--choose vehicle type, assemble the structure, place the wheels,
    and place the seats. If you think about it, you could build a car and a motorbike
    (two Builders) with this description, so we are reusing the description to create
    cars in manufacturing. The director is represented by the `ManufacturingDirector`
    type in our example.

  zh: 建造者设计模式通常被描述为导演、几个建造者和他们所建造的产品之间的关系。继续我们的汽车例子，我们将创建一个车辆建造者。创建车辆（产品）的过程（通常被称为算法）对于每一种类型的车辆来说或多或少是相同的——选择车辆类型、组装结构、放置车轮和放置座椅。如果你这么想，你可以用这个描述来建造一辆汽车和一辆摩托车（两个建造者），因此我们正在重用这个描述来在制造业中创建汽车。在我们的例子中，导演由`ManufacturingDirector`类型表示。
