The construction process is always abstracted from the user of the product.</p><p class="calibre10">At the same time, having a defined construction pattern helps when a newcomer to our source code needs to add a new product to the <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">pipeline</em></span>. The <code class="email">BuildProcess</code> interface specifies what he must comply to be part of the possible builders.</p><p class="calibre10">However, try to avoid the Builder pattern when you are not completely sure that the algorithm is going to be more or less stable because any small change in this interface will affect all your builders and it could be awkward if you add a new method that some of your builders need and others Builders do not.</p></div></div></body></html>
