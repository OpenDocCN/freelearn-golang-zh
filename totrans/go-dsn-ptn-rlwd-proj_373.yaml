- en: The Factory method pattern (or simply, Factory) is probably the second-best
    known and used design pattern in the industry. Its purpose is to abstract the
    user from the knowledge of the struct he needs to achieve for a specific purpose,
    such as retrieving some value, maybe from a web service or a database. The user
    only needs an interface that provides him this value. By delegating this decision
    to a Factory, this Factory can provide an interface that fits the user needs.
    It also eases the process of downgrading or upgrading of the implementation of
    the underlying type if needed.
