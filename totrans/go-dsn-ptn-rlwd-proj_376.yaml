- en: For our example, we are going to implement a payments method Factory, which
    is going to provide us with different ways of paying at a shop. In the beginning,
    we will have two methods of paying--cash and credit card. We'll also have an interface
    with the method, `Pay`, which every struct that wants to be used as a payment
    method must implement.
