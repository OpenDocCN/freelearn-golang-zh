  zh: 我们关于工厂方法学到的东西
- en: With the Factory method pattern, we have learned how to group families of objects
    so that their implementation is outside of our scope. We have also learned what
    to do when we need to upgrade an implementation of a used structs. Finally, we
    have seen that tests must be written with care if you don't want to tie yourself
    to certain implementations that don't have anything to do with the tests directly.

  zh: '使用工厂方法模式，我们已经学会了如何将对象家族分组，使得它们的实现超出了我们的范围。我们还学会了在需要升级已使用结构体的实现时应该做什么。最后，我们看到了如果你不想将自己绑定到与测试直接无关的某些实现上，测试必须谨慎编写。 '
