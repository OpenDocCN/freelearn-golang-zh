- en: With the Factory method pattern, we have learned how to group families of objects
    so that their implementation is outside of our scope. We have also learned what
    to do when we need to upgrade an implementation of a used structs. Finally, we
    have seen that tests must be written with care if you don't want to tie yourself
    to certain implementations that don't have anything to do with the tests directly.
