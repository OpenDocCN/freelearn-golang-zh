- en: The Abstract Factory design pattern is a new layer of grouping to achieve a
    bigger (and more complex) composite object, which is used through its interfaces.
    The idea behind grouping objects in families and grouping families is to have
    big factories that can be interchangeable and can grow more easily. In the early
    stages of development, it is also easier to work with factories and abstract factories
    than to wait until all concrete implementations are done to start your code. Also,
    you won't write an Abstract Factory from the beginning unless you know that your
    object's inventory for a particular field is going to be very large and it could
    be easily grouped into families.
