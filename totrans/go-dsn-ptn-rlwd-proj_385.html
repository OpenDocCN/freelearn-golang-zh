We want to show the similarities to solve the same problem using a different approach so that you can see the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This is going to show you the power of implicit interfaces in Go, as we won't have to touch almost anything. Finally, we are going to create a new Factory to create shipment orders.</p></div></div></body></html>
