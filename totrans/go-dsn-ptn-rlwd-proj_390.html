Like all creational patterns, this too comes in handy when creating objects, and it is very common to see the Prototype pattern surrounded by more patterns.</p><p class="calibre10">While with the Builder pattern, we are dealing with repetitive building algorithms and with the factories we are simplifying the creation of many types of objects; with the Prototype pattern, we will use an already created instance of some type to clone it and complete it with the particular needs of each context.
