- en: The aim of the Prototype pattern is to have an object or a set of objects that
    is already created at compilation time, but which you can clone as many times
    as you want at runtime. This is useful, for example, as a default template for
    a user who has just registered with your webpage or a default pricing plan in
    some service. The key difference between this and a Builder pattern is that objects
    are cloned for the user instead of building them at runtime. You can also build
    a cache-like solution, storing information using a prototype.
