- en: The aim of the Prototype pattern is to have an object or a set of objects that
    is already created at compilation time, but which you can clone as many times
    as you want at runtime. This is useful, for example, as a default template for
    a user who has just registered with your webpage or a default pricing plan in
    some service. The key difference between this and a Builder pattern is that objects
    are cloned for the user instead of building them at runtime. You can also build
    a cache-like solution, storing information using a prototype.

  zh: 原型模式的目的是在编译时已经创建了一个对象或一组对象，但在运行时你可以根据需要克隆任意多次。例如，这可以用作新注册用户在您的网页上的默认模板，或者某些服务中的默认定价计划。与建造者模式的关键区别在于，对象是为用户克隆的，而不是在运行时构建。你还可以构建一个类似缓存的解决方案，使用原型来存储信息。
