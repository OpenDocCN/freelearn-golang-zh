Each time we need a new shirt we will take this prototype, clone it and work with it. In particular, those are the acceptance criteria for using the Prototype pattern design method in this example:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">To have a shirt-cloner object and interface to ask for different types of shirts (white, black, and blue at 15.00, 16.00, and 17.00 dollars respectively)</li><li class="listitem">When you ask for a white shirt, a clone of the white shirt must be made, and the new instance must be different from the original one</li><li class="listitem">The SKU of the created object shouldn't affect new object creation</li><li class="listitem">An info method must give me all the information available on the instance fields, including the updated SKU</li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
