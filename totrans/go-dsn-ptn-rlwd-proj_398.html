Their purpose is to abstract the user from the creation of objects for complexity or maintainability purposes. They have been the foundation of thousands of applications and libraries since the 1990s, and most of the software we use today has many of these creational patterns under the hood.</p><p class="calibre10">It's worth mentioning that these patterns are not thread-free. In a more advanced chapter, we will see concurrent programming in Go, and how to create some of the more critical design patterns using a concurrent approach.</p></div></body></html>
