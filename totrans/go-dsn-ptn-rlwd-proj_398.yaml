- en: We have seen the five main creational design patterns commonly used in the software
    industry. Their purpose is to abstract the user from the creation of objects for
    complexity or maintainability purposes. They have been the foundation of thousands
    of applications and libraries since the 1990s, and most of the software we use
    today has many of these creational patterns under the hood.

    chapter, we will see concurrent programming in Go, and how to create some of the
    more critical design patterns using a concurrent approach.
