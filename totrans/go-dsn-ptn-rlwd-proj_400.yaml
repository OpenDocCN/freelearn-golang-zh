- en: The Composite design pattern favors composition (commonly defined as a *has
    a* relationship) over inheritance (an *is a* relationship). The c*omposition over
    inheritance* approach has been a source of discussions among engineers since the
    nineties. We will learn how to create object structures by using a *has a* approach.
    All in all, Go doesn't have inheritance because it doesn't need it!
