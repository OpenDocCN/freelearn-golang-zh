Objects have different objects with their own fields and methods inside them. This approach is very powerful and solves many problems of inheritance and multiple inheritances. For example, a typical inheritance problem is when you have an entity that inherits from two completely different classes, which have absolutely no relationship between them. Imagine an athlete who trains, and who is a swimmer who swims:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">Athlete</code> class has a <code class="email">Train()</code> method</li><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">Swimmer</code> class has a <code class="email">Swim()</code> method</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">The <code class="email">Swimmer</code> class inherits from the <code class="email">Athlete</code> class, so it inherits its <code class="email">Train</code> method and declares its own <code class="email">Swim</code> method. You could also have a cyclist who is also an athlete, and declares a <code class="email">Ride</code> method.</p><p class="calibre10">But now imagine an animal that eats, like a dog that also barks:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">Cyclist</code> class has a <code class="email">Ride()</code> method</li><li class="listitem">The <code class="email">Animal</code> class has <code class="email">Eat()</code>, <code class="email">Dog()</code>, and <code class="email">Bark()</code> methods</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">Nothing fancy. You could also have a fish that is an animal, and yes, swims! So, how do you solve it? A fish cannot be a swimmer that also trains. Fish don't train (as far as I know!). You could make a <code class="email">Swimmer</code> interface with a <code class="email">Swim</code> method, and make the swimmer athlete and fish implement it. This would be the best approach, but you still would have to implement <code class="email">swim</code> method twice, so code reusability would be affected. What about a triathlete? They are athletes who swim, run, and ride. With multiple inheritances, you could have a sort of solution, but that will become complex and not maintainable very soon.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
