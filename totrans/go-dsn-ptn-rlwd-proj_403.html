With Go, we can use two types of composition--the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">direct </strong></span>composition and the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">embedding</strong></span> composition. We will first solve this problem by using direct composition which is having everything that is needed as fields within the struct.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
