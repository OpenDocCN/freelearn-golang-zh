- en: We will solve the described problem of the athlete and the fish that swims in
    a very idiomatic Go way. With Go, we can use two types of composition--the **direct**
    composition and the **embedding** composition. We will first solve this problem
    by using direct composition which is having everything that is needed as fields
    within the struct.
