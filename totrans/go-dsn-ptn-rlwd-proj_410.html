Instead, you create a new interface to deal with the current needs of your application, which, under the hood, uses implementations of the old interface.</p><p class="calibre10">Adapter also helps us to maintain the <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">open/closed principle</em></span> in our apps, making them more predictable too. They also allow us to write code which uses some base that we can't modify.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note013" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">The open/closed principle was first stated by Bertrand Meyer in his book <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Object-Oriented Software Construction</em></span>. He stated that code should be open to new functionality, but closed to modifications. What does it mean? Well, it implies a few things. On one hand, we should try to write code that is extensible and not only one that works. At the same time, we should try not to modify the source code (yours or other people's) as much as we can, because we aren't always aware of the implications of this modification. Just keep in mind that extensibility in code is only possible through the use of design patterns and interface-oriented programming.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
