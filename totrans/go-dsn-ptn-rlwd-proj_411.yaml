- en: The Adapter design pattern will help you fit the needs of two parts of the code
    that are incompatible at first. This is the key to being kept in mind when deciding
    if the Adapter pattern is a good design for your problem--two interfaces that
    are incompatible, but which must work together, are good candidates for an Adapter
    pattern (but they could also use the facade pattern, for example).
