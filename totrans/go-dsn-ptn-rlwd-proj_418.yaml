- en: 'The **Bridge** pattern is a design with a slightly cryptic definition from
    the original *Gang of Four* book. It decouples an abstraction from its implementation
    so that the two can vary independently. This cryptic explanation just means that
    you could even decouple the most basic form of functionality: decouple an object
    from what it does.'
