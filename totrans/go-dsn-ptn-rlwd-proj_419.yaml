- en: The Bridge pattern tries to decouple things as usual with design patterns. It
    decouples abstraction (an object) from its implementation (the thing that the
    object does). This way, we can change what an object does as much as we want.
    It also allows us to change the abstracted object while reusing the same implementation.
