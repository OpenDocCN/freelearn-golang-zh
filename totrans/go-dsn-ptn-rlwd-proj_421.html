We will have two implementations. The first will write to the console. Having learned about the <code class="email">io.Writer</code> interface in the previous section, we will make the second write to an <code class="email">io.Writer</code>Â interface to provide more flexibility to the solution. We will also have two abstracted object users of the implementations--a <code class="email">Normal</code> object, which will use each implementation in a straightforward manner, and a <code class="email">Packt</code> implementation, which will append the sentence <code class="email">Message from Packt:</code> to the printing message.</p><p class="calibre10">At the end of this section, we will have two abstraction objects, which have two different implementations of their functionality. So, actually, we will have 2<sup class="calibre26">2</sup> possible combinations of object functionality.</p></div></div></body></html>
