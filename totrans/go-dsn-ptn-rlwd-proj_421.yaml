- en: For our example, we will go to a console printer abstraction to keep it simple.
    We will have two implementations. The first will write to the console. Having
    learned about the `io.Writer` interface in the previous section, we will make
    the second write to an `io.Writer` interface to provide more flexibility to the
    solution. We will also have two abstracted object users of the implementations--a
    `Normal` object, which will use each implementation in a straightforward manner,
    and a `Packt` implementation, which will append the sentence `Message from Packt:`
    to the printing message.

    two different implementations of their functionality. So, actually, we will have
    2² possible combinations of object functionality.
