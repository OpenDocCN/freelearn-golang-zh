This way, we can reuse its abstractions as well as its implementations. We can swap the printer abstractions as well as the printer APIs as much as we want without affecting the user code.</p><p class="calibre10">We have also tried to keep things as simple as possible, but I'm sure that you have realized that all implementations of the <code class="email">PrinterAPI</code> interface could have been created using a factory. This would be very natural, and you could find many implementations that have followed this approach. However, we shouldn't get into over-engineering, but should analyze each problem to make a precise design of its needs and finds the best way to create a reusable, maintainable, and <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">readable</em></span> source code. Readable code is commonly forgotten, but a robust and uncoupled source code is useless if nobody can understand it to maintain it. It's like a book of the tenth century--it could be a precious story but pretty frustrating if we have difficulty understanding its grammar.</p></div></div></body></html>
