- en: The Proxy pattern usually wraps an object to hide some of its characteristics.
    These characteristics could be the fact that it is a remote object (remote proxy),
    a very heavy object such as a very big image or the dump of a terabyte database
    (virtual proxy), or a restricted access object (protection proxy).
