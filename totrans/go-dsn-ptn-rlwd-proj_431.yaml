- en: For our example, we are going to create a remote proxy, which is going to be
    a cache of objects before accessing a database. Let's imagine that we have a database
    with many users, but instead of accessing the database each time we want information
    about a user, we will have a **First In First Out** (**FIFO**) stack of users
    in a Proxy pattern (FIFO is a way of saying that when the cache needs to be emptied,
    it will delete the first object that entered first).
