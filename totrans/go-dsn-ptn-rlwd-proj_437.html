How is it possible? Well, it uses an approach similar to <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">matryoshka dolls</em></span>, where you have a small doll that you can put inside a doll of the same shape but bigger, and so on and so forth.</p><p class="calibre10">The Decorator type implements the same interface of the type it decorates, and stores an instance of that type in its members. This way, you can stack as many decorators (dolls) as you want by simply storing the old decorator in a field of the new one.</p></div></div></body></html>
