- en: The Decorator design pattern allows you to decorate an already existing type
    with more functional features without actually touching it. How is it possible?
    Well, it uses an approach similar to *matryoshka dolls*, where you have a small
    doll that you can put inside a doll of the same shape but bigger, and so on and
    so forth.

- en: The Decorator type implements the same interface of the type it decorates, and
    stores an instance of that type in its members. This way, you can stack as many
    decorators (dolls) as you want by simply storing the old decorator in a field
    of the new one.
