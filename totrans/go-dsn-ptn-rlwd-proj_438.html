It's a really powerful approach to deal with this particular problem.</p><p class="calibre10">A different field where the Decorator is very powerful may not be so obvious though it reveals itself when creating types with lots of features based on user inputs, preferences, or similar inputs. Like in a Swiss knife, you have a base type (the frame of the knife), and from there you unfold its functionalities.</p><p class="calibre10">So, precisely when are we going to use the Decorator pattern? Answer to this question:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">When you need to add functionality to some code that you don't have access to, or you don't want to modify to avoid a negative effect on the code, and follow the open/close principle (like legacy code)</li><li class="listitem">When you want the functionality of an object to be created or altered dynamically, and the number of features is unknown and could grow fast</li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
