This is when your structure defines your type without explicitly writing it. For example, when you implement an interface, you don't have to write explicitly that you are actually implementing it, contrary to languages such as Java where you have to write the keyword <code class="email">implements</code>. If your method follows the signature of the interface, you are actually implementing the interface. This can also lead to accidental implementations of interface, something that could provoke an impossible-to-track mistake, but that is very unlikely.</p><p class="calibre10">However, structural typing also allows you to define an interface after defining their implementers. Imagine a <code class="email">MyPrinter</code> struct as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">type MyPrinter struct{} 
func(m *MyPrinter)Print(){ 
  println("Hello") 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">Imagine we have been working with the <code class="email">MyPrinter</code> type for few months now, but it didn't implement any interface, so it can't be a possible candidate for a Decorator pattern, or maybe it can? What if we wrote an interface that matches its <code class="email">Print</code> method after a few months? Consider the following code snippet:</p><pre class="programlisting">type Printer interface { 
  Print() 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">It actually implements the <code class="email">Printer</code> interface, and we can use it to create a Decorator solution.</p><p class="calibre10">Structural typing allows a lot of flexibility when writing programs. If you don't know whether a type should be a part of an interface or not, you can leave it and add the interface later, when you are completely sure about it. This way, you can decorate types very easily and with little modification in your source code.</p></div></div></body></html>
