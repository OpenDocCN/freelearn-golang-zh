In the Decorator pattern, we decorate a type dynamically. This means that the decoration may or may not be there, or it may be composed of one or many types. If you remember, the Proxy pattern wraps a type in a similar fashion, but it does so at compile time and it's more like a way to access some type.</p><p class="calibre10">At the same time, a decorator might implement the entire interface that the type it decorates also implements <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">or not</strong></span>. So you can have an interface with 10 methods and a decorator that just implements one of them and it will still be valid. A call on a method not implemented by the decorator will be passed to the decorated type. This is a very powerful feature but also very prone to undesired behaviors at runtime if you forget to implement any interface method.</p><p class="calibre10">In this aspect, you may think that the Proxy pattern is less flexible, and it is. But the Decorator pattern is weaker, as you could have errors at runtime, which you can avoid at compile time by using the Proxy pattern. Just keep in mind that the Decorator is commonly used when you want to add functionality to an object at runtime, like in our web server. It's a compromise between what you need and what you want to sacrifice to achieve it.</p></div></div></body></html>
