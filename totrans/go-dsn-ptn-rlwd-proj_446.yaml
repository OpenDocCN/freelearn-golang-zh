- en: The next pattern we'll see in this chapter is the Facade pattern. When we discussed
    the Proxy pattern, you got to know that it was a way to wrap an type to hide some
    of its features of complexity from the user. Imagine that we group many proxies
    in a single point such as a file or a library. This could be a Facade pattern.
