A library is a form of facade, where someone has to provide some methods for a developer to do certain things in a friendly way. This way, if a developer needs to use your library, he doesn't need to know all the inner tasks to retrieve the result he/she wants.</p><p class="calibre10">So, you use the Facade design pattern in the following scenarios:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">When you want to decrease the complexity of some parts of our code. You hide that complexity behind the facade by providing a more easy-to-use method.</li><li class="listitem">When you want to group actions that are cross-related in a single place.</li><li class="listitem">When you want to build a library so that others can use your products without worrying about how it all works.</li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
