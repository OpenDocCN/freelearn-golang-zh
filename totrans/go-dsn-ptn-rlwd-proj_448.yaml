- en: You use Facade when you want to hide the complexity of some tasks, especially
    when most of them share utilities (such as authentication in an API). A library
    is a form of facade, where someone has to provide some methods for a developer
    to do certain things in a friendly way. This way, if a developer needs to use
    your library, he doesn't need to know all the inner tasks to retrieve the result
    he/she wants.
