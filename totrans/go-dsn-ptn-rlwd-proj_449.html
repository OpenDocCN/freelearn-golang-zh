In case you are not familiar with <code class="email">OpenWeatherMap</code> service, it is an HTTP service that provides you with live information about weather, as well as historical data on it. The <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">HTTP REST</strong></span> API is very easy to use, and will be a good example on how to create a Facade pattern for hiding the complexity of the network connections behind the REST service.</p></div></div></body></html>
