- en: As an example, we are going to take the first steps toward writing our own library
    that accesses `OpenWeatherMaps` service. In case you are not familiar with `OpenWeatherMap`
    service, it is an HTTP service that provides you with live information about weather,
    as well as historical data on it. The **HTTP REST** API is very easy to use, and
    will be a good example on how to create a Facade pattern for hiding the complexity
    of the network connections behind the REST service.
