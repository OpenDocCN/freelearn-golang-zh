- en: Flyweight is a pattern which allows sharing the state of a heavy object between
    many instances of some type. Imagine that you have to create and store too many
    objects of some heavy type that are fundamentally equal. You'll run out of memory
    pretty quickly. This problem can be easily solved with the Flyweight pattern,
    with additional help of the Factory pattern. The factory is usually in charge
    of encapsulating object creation, as we saw previously.
