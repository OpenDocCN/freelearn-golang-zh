- en: To give an example, we are going to simulate something that you find on betting
    webpages. Imagine the final match of the European championship, which is viewed
    by millions of people across the continent. Now imagine that we own a betting
    webpage, where we provide historical information about every team in Europe. This
    is plenty of information, which is usually stored in some distributed database,
    and each team has, literally, megabytes of information about their players, matches,
    championships, and so on.

- en: If a million users access information about a team and a new instance of the
    information is created for each user querying for historical data, we will run
    out of memory in the blink of an eye. With our Proxy solution, we could make a
    cache of the *n* most recent searches to speed up queries, but if we return a
    clone for every team, we will still get short on memory (but faster thanks to
    our cache). Funny, right?

- en: Instead, we will store each team's information just once, and we will deliver
    references to them to the users. So, if we face a million users trying to access
    information about a match, we will actually just have two teams in memory with
    a million pointers to the same memory direction.
