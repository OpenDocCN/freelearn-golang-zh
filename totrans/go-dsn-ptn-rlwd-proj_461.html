With the Singleton pattern, we ensure that the same type is created only once. Also, the Singleton pattern is a Creational pattern. With Flyweight, which is a Structural pattern, we aren't worried about how the objects are created, but about how to structure a type to contain heavy information in a light way. The structure we are talking about is the <code class="email">map[int]*Team</code> structure in our example. Here, we really didn't care about how we created the object; we have simply written an uncomplicated the <code class="email">getTeamFactory</code> method for it. We gave major importance to having a light structure to hold a shareable object (or objects), in this case, the map.</p></div></div></body></html>
