Structural patterns are concerned about how to create objects, or how they do their business (we'll see this in the behavioral patterns).</p><p class="calibre10">Don't feel confused about mixing several patterns. You could end up mixing six or seven quite easily if you strictly follow the objectives of each one. Just keep in mind that over-engineering is as bad as no engineering at all. I remember prototyping a load balancer one evening, and after two hours of crazy over-engineered code, I had such a mess in my head that I preferred to start all over again.</p><p class="calibre10">In the next chapter, we'll see behavioral patterns. They are a bit more complex, and they often use Structural and Creational patterns for their objectives, but I'm sure that the reader will find them quite challenging and interesting.</p></div></body></html>
