  zh: 摘要
- en: We have seen several patterns to organize code structures. Structural patterns
    are concerned about how to create objects, or how they do their business (we'll
    see this in the behavioral patterns).

  zh: 我们已经看到了几种组织代码结构的模式。结构模式关注的是如何创建对象，或者它们是如何进行业务处理的（我们将在行为模式中看到这一点）。
- en: Don't feel confused about mixing several patterns. You could end up mixing six
    or seven quite easily if you strictly follow the objectives of each one. Just
    keep in mind that over-engineering is as bad as no engineering at all. I remember
    prototyping a load balancer one evening, and after two hours of crazy over-engineered
    code, I had such a mess in my head that I preferred to start all over again.

  zh: 不要因为混合多种模式而感到困惑。如果你严格遵循每种模式的目标，你可能会轻松地混合六种或七种。只需记住，过度设计和不设计一样糟糕。我记得有一天晚上我在原型设计一个负载均衡器，经过两个小时疯狂的超前设计代码后，我头脑中一团糟，宁愿从头开始。
- en: In the next chapter, we'll see behavioral patterns. They are a bit more complex,
    and they often use Structural and Creational patterns for their objectives, but
    I'm sure that the reader will find them quite challenging and interesting.

  zh: 在下一章中，我们将看到行为模式。它们稍微复杂一些，并且它们通常使用结构和创建模式来实现目标，但我相信读者会发现它们相当具有挑战性和有趣。
