    are concerned about how to create objects, or how they do their business (we'll
    see this in the behavioral patterns).

    or seven quite easily if you strictly follow the objectives of each one. Just
    keep in mind that over-engineering is as bad as no engineering at all. I remember
    prototyping a load balancer one evening, and after two hours of crazy over-engineered
    code, I had such a mess in my head that I preferred to start all over again.

    and they often use Structural and Creational patterns for their objectives, but
    I'm sure that the reader will find them quite challenging and interesting.
