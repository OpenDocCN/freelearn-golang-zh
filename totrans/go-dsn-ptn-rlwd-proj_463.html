Now, we aren't going to define structures or encapsulate object creation but we are going to deal with behaviors.</p><p class="calibre10">What's to deal with in behavior patterns? Well, now we will encapsulate behaviors, for example, algorithms in the Strategy pattern or executions in the command pattern.</p><p class="calibre10">Correct Behavior design is the last step after knowing how to deal with object creation and structures. Defining the behavior correctly is the last step of good software design because, all in all, good software design lets us improve algorithms and fix errors easily while the best algorithm implementation will not save us from bad software design.</p></div></body></html>
