- en: The last group of common patterns we are going to see are the behavioral patterns.
    Now, we aren't going to define structures or encapsulate object creation but we
    are going to deal with behaviors.

- en: What's to deal with in behavior patterns? Well, now we will encapsulate behaviors,
    for example, algorithms in the Strategy pattern or executions in the command pattern.

- en: Correct Behavior design is the last step after knowing how to deal with object
    creation and structures. Defining the behavior correctly is the last step of good
    software design because, all in all, good software design lets us improve algorithms
    and fix errors easily while the best algorithm implementation will not save us
    from bad software design.
