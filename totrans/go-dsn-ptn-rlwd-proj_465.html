These algorithms are hidden behind an interface and, of course, they must be interchangeable. All algorithms achieve the same functionality in a different way. For example, we could have a <code class="email">Sort</code> interface and few sorting algorithms. The result is the same, some list is sorted, but we could have used quick sort, merge sort, and so on.</p><p class="calibre10">Can you guess when we used a Strategy pattern in the previous chapters? Three, two, one... Well, we heavily used the strategy pattern when we used the <code class="email">io.Writer</code> interface. The <code class="email">io.Writer</code> interface defines a strategy to write, and the functionality is always the same--to write something. We could write it to the standard out, to some file or to a user-defined type, but we do the same thing at the end--to write. We just change the strategy to write (in this case, we change the place where we write).</p></div></div></div></body></html>
