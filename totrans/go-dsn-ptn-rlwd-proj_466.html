The pattern should do the following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Provide a few algorithms to achieve some specific functionality</li><li class="listitem">All types achieve the same functionality in a different way but the client of the strategy isn't affected</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">The problem is that this definition coversÂ a huge spectrum of possibilities. This is because Strategy pattern is actually used for a variety of scenarios and many software engineering solutions come with some kind of strategy within. Therefore it's better to see it in action with a real example.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
