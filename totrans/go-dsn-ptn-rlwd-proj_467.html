Instead of printing text on the console only, we are also going to paint objects on a file.</p><p class="calibre10">In this case, we will have two strategies: console and file. But the user of the library won't have to deal with the complexity behind them.</p><p class="calibre10">The key feature is that the "caller" doesn´t know how the underlying library is working and he just knows the information available on the defined strategy. This is nicely seen on the following diagram:</p><p class="calibre10">

The <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">ConsoleStrategy</strong></span> type will hide the implementation details of printing to console to caller in <code class="email">main</code> function. <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">FileStrategy</strong></span> hides its implementation details as well as any future strategy.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
