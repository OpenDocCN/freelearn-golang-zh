    text on the console only, we are also going to paint objects on a file.

    **ConsoleStrategy** type directly, we´ll always use an interface that represents
    it. The **ConsoleStrategy** type will hide the implementation details of printing
    to console to caller in `main` function. **FileStrategy** hides its implementation details
    as well as any future strategy.
