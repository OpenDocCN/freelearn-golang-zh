- en: We have learned a powerful way to encapsulate algorithms in different structs.
    We have also used embedding instead of inheritance to provide cross-functionality
    between types, which will come in handy very often in our apps. You'll find yourself
    combining strategies here and there as we have seen in the second example, where
    we have strategies for logging and writing by using the `io.Writer` interface,
    a strategy for byte-streaming operations.
