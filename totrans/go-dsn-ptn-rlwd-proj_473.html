This way, we can apply many functions that achieve one specific thing each to some struct, slice, map, and so on.</p><p class="calibre10">When we apply many of these abstractions in a logical way very often, we can chain them to execute in order such as, for example, a logging chain.</p><p class="calibre10">A logging chain is a set of types that logs the output of some program to more than one <code class="email">io.Writer</code> interface. We could have a type that logs to the console, a type that logs to a file, and a type that logs to a remote server. You can make three calls every time you want to do some logging, but it's more elegant to make only one and provoke a chain reaction.</p><p class="calibre10">But also, we could have a chain of checks and, in case one of them fails, break the chain and return something. This is the authentication and authorization middleware works.</p></div></div></body></html>
