The actions are chained to each other and each link will execute some action and pass the request to the next link (or not). The following are the objectives followed by this pattern:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Dynamically chain the actions at runtime based on some input</li><li class="listitem">Pass a request through a chain of processors until one of them can process it, in which case the chain could be stopped</li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
