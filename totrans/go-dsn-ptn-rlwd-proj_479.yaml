- en: We learned a powerful tool to achieve dynamic processing of actions and state
    handling. The Chain of responsibility pattern is widely used, also to create **Finite
    State Machines** (**FSM**). It is also used interchangeably with the Decorator
    pattern with the difference that when you decorate, you change the structure of
    an object while with the chain you define a behavior for each link in the chain
    that can break it too.
