While in the strategy pattern we focus on changing algorithms, in the Command pattern, we focus on the invocation of something or on the abstraction of some type.</p><p class="calibre10">A Command pattern is commonly seen as a container. You put something like the info for user interaction on a UI that could be <code class="email">click on login</code> and pass it as a command. You don't need to have the complexity related toÂ the <code class="email">click on login</code> action in the command but simply the action itself.</p><p class="calibre10">An example for the organic world would be a box for a delivery company. We can put anything on it but, as a delivery company, we are interested in managing the box instead of its contents directly.</p><p class="calibre10">The command pattern will be used heavily when dealing with channels. With channels you can send any message through it but, if we need a response from the receiving side of the channel, a common approach is to create a command that has a second, response channel attached where we are listening.</p><p class="calibre10">Similarly, a good example would be a multi-player video game, where every stroke of each user can be sent as commands to the rest of the users through the network.</p></div></div></body></html>
