When using this constructor with a <code class="email">string</code>, it will return a command that will print it. In this case, the handler is inside the command that acts as a box and as a handler.</li><li class="listitem">We need a data structure that stores incoming commands in a queue and prints them once the queue reaches the length of three.</li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
