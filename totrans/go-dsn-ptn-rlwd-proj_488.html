It looks very similar to the Strategy pattern but remember that Strategy is about having many algorithms to achieve some specific task, but all of them achieve the same task. In the Command pattern, you have many tasks to execute, and not all of them need to be equal.</p><p class="calibre10">So, in short, the Command pattern is about execution encapsulation and delegation so that just the receiver or receivers trigger that execution.</p></div></div></body></html>
