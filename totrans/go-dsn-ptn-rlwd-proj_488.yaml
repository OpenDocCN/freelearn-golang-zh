- en: Command is a very tiny design pattern; its functionality is quite easy to understand
    but it's widely used for its simplicity. It looks very similar to the Strategy
    pattern but remember that Strategy is about having many algorithms to achieve
    some specific task, but all of them achieve the same task. In the Command pattern,
    you have many tasks to execute, and not all of them need to be equal.

    so that just the receiver or receivers trigger that execution.
