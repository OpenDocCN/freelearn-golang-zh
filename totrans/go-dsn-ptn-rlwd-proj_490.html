The difficulty is being raised as now we will use combinations of Structural and Creational patterns to better solve the objective of some of the Behavioral patterns.</p><p class="calibre10">We will start with Template design pattern, a pattern that looks very similar to the Strategy pattern but that provides greater flexibility. Memento design pattern is used in 99% of applications we use every day to achieve undo functions and transactional operations. Finally, we will write a reverse polish notation interpreter to perform simple mathematical operations.</p><p class="calibre10">Let's start with the Template design pattern.</p></div></body></html>
