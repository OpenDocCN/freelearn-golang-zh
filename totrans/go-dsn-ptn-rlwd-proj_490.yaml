- en: We will start with Template design pattern, a pattern that looks very similar
    to the Strategy pattern but that provides greater flexibility. Memento design
    pattern is used in 99% of applications we use every day to achieve undo functions
    and transactional operations. Finally, we will write a reverse polish notation
    interpreter to perform simple mathematical operations.
