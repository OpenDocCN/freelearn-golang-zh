The idea is to provide a user some way to execute code within an algorithm.</p><p class="calibre10">In this section, we will see how to write idiomatic Go Template patterns and see some Go source code where it's wisely used. We will write an algorithm of three steps where the second step is delegated to the user while the first and third aren't. The first and third steps on the algorithm represent the template.</p></div></div></body></html>
