- en: The **Template** pattern is one of those widely used patterns that are incredibly
    useful, especially when writing libraries and frameworks. The idea is to provide
    a user some way to execute code within an algorithm.

- en: In this section, we will see how to write idiomatic Go Template patterns and
    see some Go source code where it's wisely used. We will write an algorithm of
    three steps where the second step is delegated to the user while the first and
    third aren't. The first and third steps on the algorithm represent the template.
