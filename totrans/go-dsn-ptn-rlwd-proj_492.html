This is common when creating libraries to ease in some complex task or when reusability of some algorithm is compromised by only a part of it.</p><p class="calibre10">Imagine, for example, that we have a long transaction of HTTP requests. We have to perform the following steps:</p><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Authenticate user.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Authorize him.</li><li class="listitem" value="3">Retrieve some details from a database.</li><li class="listitem" value="4">Make some modification.</li><li class="listitem" value="5">Send the details back in a new request.</li></ol><div class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre10">It wouldn't make sense to repeat steps 1 to 5 in the user's code every time he needs to modify something on the database. Instead, steps 1, 2, 3, and 5 will be abstracted in the same algorithm that receives an interface with whatever the fifth step needs to finish the transaction. It doesn't need to be a interface either, it could be a callback.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
