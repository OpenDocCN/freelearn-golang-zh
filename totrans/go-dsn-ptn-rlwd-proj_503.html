Basically, we'll have a type with some state and we want to be able to save milestones of its state. Having a finite amount of states saved, we can recover them if necessary for a variety of tasks-undo operations, historic, and so on.</p><p class="calibre10">The Memento design pattern usually has three players (usually called <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">actors</strong></span>):</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Memento</strong></span>: A type that stores the type we want to save. Usually, we won't store the business type directly and we provide an extra layer of abstraction through this type.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Originator</strong></span>: A type that is in charge of creating mementos and storing the current active state. We said that the Memento type wraps states of the business type and we use originator as the creator of mementos.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Care Taker</strong></span>: A type that stores the list of mementos that can have the logic to store them in a database or to not store more than a specified number of them.</li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
