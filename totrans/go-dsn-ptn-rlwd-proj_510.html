In any case, the situation is the same: you need a <code class="email">Memento</code>, an <code class="email">Originator</code>, and a <code class="email">caretaker</code> actor.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip018" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre10">A <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">transaction operation</strong></span> is a set of atomic operations that must all be done or fail. In other words, if you have a transaction composed of five operations and just one of them fails, the transaction cannot be completed and every modification done by the other four must be undone.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
