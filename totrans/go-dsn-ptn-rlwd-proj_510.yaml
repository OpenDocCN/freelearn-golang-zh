    operations that are very useful when writing UI applications but also when you
    have to develop transactional operations. In any case, the situation is the same:
    you need a `Memento`, an `Originator`, and a `caretaker` actor.'

- en: A **transaction operation** is a set of atomic operations that must all be done
    or fail. In other words, if you have a transaction composed of five operations
    and just one of them fails, the transaction cannot be completed and every modification
    done by the other four must be undone.
