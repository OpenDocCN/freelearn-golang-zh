    as a special-purpose programming language for managing data held in relational
    databases. SQL is quite complex and big but, all in all, is a set of words and
    operators that allow us to perform operations such as insert, select, or delete.

    interpreter is the musician who knows the connection between a note and its representation
    on the instrument they are playing.
