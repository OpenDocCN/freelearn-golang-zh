- en: A very typical example of an interpreter is to create a reverse polish notation
    calculator. For those who don't know what polish notation is, it's a mathematical
    notation to make operations where you write your operation first (sum) and then
    the values (3 4), so *+ 3 4* is equivalent to the more common *3 + 4* and its
    result would be *7*. So, for a reverse polish notation, you put first the values
    and then the operation, so *3 4 +* would also be *7*.
