To create a language, it generates a strong coupling between its users and the functionality it provides. One can fall into the error of trying to create a too flexible language that is incredibly complex to use and maintain. Also, one can create a fairly small and useful language that doesn't interpret correctly sometimes and it could be a pain for its users.</p><p class="calibre10">In our example, we have omitted quite a lot of error-checking to focus on the implementation of the Interpreter. However, you'll need quite a lot of error checking and verbose output on errors to help the user correct its syntax errors. So, have fun writing your language but be nice to your users.</p></div></div></body></html>
