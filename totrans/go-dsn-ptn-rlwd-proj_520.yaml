- en: This pattern is extremely powerful but it must also be used carefully. To create
    a language, it generates a strong coupling between its users and the functionality
    it provides. One can fall into the error of trying to create a too flexible language
    that is incredibly complex to use and maintain. Also, one can create a fairly
    small and useful language that doesn't interpret correctly sometimes and it could
    be a pain for its users.

- en: In our example, we have omitted quite a lot of error-checking to focus on the
    implementation of the Interpreter. However, you'll need quite a lot of error checking
    and verbose output on errors to help the user correct its syntax errors. So, have
    fun writing your language but be nice to your users.
