It's a very good idea to make some exercises with them by simulating typical production problems:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Create a simple REST server that reuses most of the error-checking and connection functionality to provide an easy-to-use interface to practice the Template pattern</li><li class="listitem">Make a small library that can write to different databases but only in the case that all writes were OK, or delete the newly created writes to practice Memento for example</li><li class="listitem">Write your own language, to make simple things such as answering simple questions like bots usually do so you can practice a bit of the Interpreter pattern</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">The idea is to practice coding and reread any section until you get comfortable with each pattern.</p></div></body></html>
