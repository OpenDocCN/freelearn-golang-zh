So we could have many different visitors that do some things to specific types.</p><p class="calibre10">For example, imagine that we have a log writer that writes to console. We could make the logger "visitable" so that you can prepend any text to each log. We could write a Visitor pattern that prepends the date, the time, and the hostname to a field stored in the object.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
