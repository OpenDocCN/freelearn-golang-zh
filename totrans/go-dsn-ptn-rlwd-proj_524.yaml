- en: In the Visitor design pattern, we are trying to separate the logic needed to
    work with a specific object outside of the object itself. So we could have many
    different visitors that do some things to specific types.

- en: For example, imagine that we have a log writer that writes to console. We could
    make the logger "visitable" so that you can prepend any text to each log. We could
    write a Visitor pattern that prepends the date, the time, and the hostname to
    a field stored in the object.
