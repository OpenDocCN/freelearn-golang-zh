Visitor patterns are not an exception. The objectives that we are trying to achieve are as follows:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">To separate the algorithm of some type from its implementation within some other type</li><li class="listitem">To improve the flexibility of some types by using them with little or no logic at all so all new functionality can be added without altering the object structure</li><li class="listitem">To fix a structure or behavior that would break the open/closed principle in a type</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">You might be thinking what the open/closed principle is. In computer science, the open/closed principle states that: <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">entities should be open for </em></span>
<span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">extension but closed for modification</em></span>. This simple state has lots of implications that allows building more maintainable software and less prone to errors. And the Visitor pattern helps us to delegate some commonly changing algorithm from a type that we need it to be "stable" to an external type that can change often without affecting our original one.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
