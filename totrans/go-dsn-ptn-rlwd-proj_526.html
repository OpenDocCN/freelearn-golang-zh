Following the approach we have had in previous chapters, we will start with an extremely simple example to clearly understand how the Visitor design pattern works before jumping to a more complex one. We have already developed similar examples modifying texts too, but in slightly different ways.</p><p class="calibre10">For this particular example, we will create a Visitor that appends different information to the types it "visits".</p></div></div></div></body></html>
