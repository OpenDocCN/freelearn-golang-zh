- en: We are going to develop a simple log appender as an example of the Visitor pattern.
    Following the approach we have had in previous chapters, we will start with an
    extremely simple example to clearly understand how the Visitor design pattern
    works before jumping to a more complex one. We have already developed similar
    examples modifying texts too, but in slightly different ways.

    information to the types it "visits".
