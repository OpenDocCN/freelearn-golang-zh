- en: A light switch is a common example of an FSM. It has two states--on and off.
    One state can transit to the other and vice versa. The way that the State pattern
    works is similar. We have a `State` interface and an implementation of each state
    we want to achieve. There is also usually a context that holds cross-information
    between the states.

- en: With FSM, we can achieve very complex behaviors by splitting their scope between
    states. This way we can model pipelines of execution based on any kind of inputs
    or create event-driven software that responds to particular events in specified
    ways.
