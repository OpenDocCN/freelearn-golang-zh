This game is a number guessing game. The idea is simple--we will have to guess some number between 0 and 10 and we have just a few attemptsÂ or we'll lose.</p><p class="calibre10">We will leave the player to choose the level of difficulty by asking how many tries the user has before losing. Then, we will ask the player for the correct number and keep asking if they don't guess it or if the number of tries reaches zero.</p></div></div></body></html>
