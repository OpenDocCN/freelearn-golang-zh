- en: We are going to develop a very simple game that uses FSM. This game is a number
    guessing game. The idea is simple--we will have to guess some number between 0
    and 10 and we have just a few attemptsÂ or we'll lose.

- en: We will leave the player to choose the level of difficulty by asking how many
    tries the user has before losing. Then, we will ask the player for the correct
    number and keep asking if they don't guess it or if the number of tries reaches
    zero.
