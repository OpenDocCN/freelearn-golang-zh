- en: We are going to develop a very simple game that uses FSM. This game is a number
    guessing game. The idea is simple--we will have to guess some number between 0
    and 10 and we have just a few attempts or we'll lose.

  zh: 我们将开发一个非常简单的使用有限状态机（FSM）的游戏。这个游戏是一个数字猜谜游戏。想法很简单——我们需要猜测一个介于0到10之间的数字，我们只有几次机会，否则就会失败。
- en: We will leave the player to choose the level of difficulty by asking how many
    tries the user has before losing. Then, we will ask the player for the correct
    number and keep asking if they don't guess it or if the number of tries reaches
    zero.

  zh: 我们将让玩家通过询问他们在失败之前有多少次尝试来选择难度级别。然后，我们将询问玩家正确的数字，如果他们猜错了或者尝试次数达到零，我们会继续询问。
