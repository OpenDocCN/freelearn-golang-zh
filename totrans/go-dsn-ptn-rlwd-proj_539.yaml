- en: You must be thinking now that you can extend this game forever with new states,
    and it's true. The power of the State pattern is not only the capacity to create
    a complex FSM, but also the flexibility to improve it as much as you want by adding
    new states and modifying some old states to point to the new ones without affecting
    the rest of the FSM.
