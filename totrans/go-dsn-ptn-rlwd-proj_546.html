Tight coupling between entities in an app can become really complex to deal with in the future and allow more difficult refactoring if needed.</p><p class="calibre10">Just remember that the Mediator pattern is there to act as a managing type between two types that don't know about each other so that you can take one of the types without affecting the other and replace a type in a more easy and convenient way.</p></div></div></body></html>
