- en: We have carried out a disruptive example to try to think outside the box and
    reason deeply about the Mediator pattern. Tight coupling between entities in an
    app can become really complex to deal with in the future and allow more difficult
    refactoring if needed.

- en: Just remember that the Mediator pattern is there to act as a managing type between
    two types that don't know about each other so that you can take one of the types
    without affecting the other and replace a type in a more easy and convenient way.
