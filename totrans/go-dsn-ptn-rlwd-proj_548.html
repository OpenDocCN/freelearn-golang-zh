Why is this so interesting? Because we uncouple an event from its possible handlers.</p><p class="calibre10">For example, imagine a login button. We could code that when the user clicks the button, the button color changes, an action is executed, and a form check is performed in the background. But with the Observer pattern, the type that changes the color will subscribe to the event of the clicking of the button. The type that checks the form and the type that performs an action will subscribe to this event too.</p></div></div></body></html>
