- en: The idea behind the Observer pattern is simple--to subscribe to some event that
    will trigger some behavior on many subscribed types. Why is this so interesting?
    Because we uncouple an event from its possible handlers.

- en: For example, imagine a login button. We could code that when the user clicks
    the button, the button color changes, an action is executed, and a form check
    is performed in the background. But with the Observer pattern, the type that changes
    the color will subscribe to the event of the clicking of the button. The type
    that checks the form and the type that performs an action will subscribe to this
    event too.
