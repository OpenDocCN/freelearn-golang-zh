It is also especially useful when you don't know how many actions are performed after an event in advance or there is a possibility that the number of actions is going to grow in theÂ near future. To resume, do the following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Provide an event-driven architecture where one event can trigger one or more actions</li><li class="listitem">Uncouple the actions that are performed from the event that triggers them</li><li class="listitem">Provide more than one event that triggers the same action</li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
