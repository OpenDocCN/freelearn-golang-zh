We are going to make a <code class="email">Publisher</code> struct, which is the one that triggers an event so it must accept new observers and remove them if necessary. When the <code class="email">Publisher</code>Â struct is triggered, it must notify all its observers of the new event with the data associated.</p></div></div></body></html>
