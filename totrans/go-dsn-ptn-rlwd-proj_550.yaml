- en: We will develop the simplest possible application to fully understand the roots
    of the Observer pattern. We are going to make a `Publisher` struct, which is the
    one that triggers an event so it must accept new observers and remove them if
    necessary. When the `Publisher`Â struct is triggered, it must notify all its observers
    of the new event with the data associated.
