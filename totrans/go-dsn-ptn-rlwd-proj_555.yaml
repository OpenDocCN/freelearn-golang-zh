- en: We have just finished with the *Gang Of Four* design patterns that are commonly
    used in object oriented programming languages. They have been used extensively
    for the last few decades (even before they were explicitly defined in a book).

- en: In this chapter, we are going to see concurrency in the Go language. We will,
    learn that with multiple cores and multiple processes, applications can help us
    to achieve better performance and endless possibilities. We will look at how to
    use some of the already known patterns in concurrently safe ways.
