</p><p class="calibre10">In the actor model, if <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Actor 1</strong></span> wants to communicate with <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Actor 2</strong></span>, then <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Actor 1</strong></span> must know <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Actor 2</strong></span> first; for example, it must have its process ID, maybe from the creation step, and put a message on its inbox queue. After placing the message, <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Actor 1</strong></span> can continue its tasks without getting blocked if <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Actor 2</strong></span> cannot process the message immediately.</p><p class="calibre10">CSP, on the other side, introduces a new entity into the equation-channels. Channels are the way to communicate between processes because they are completely anonymous (unlike actors, where we need to know their process IDs). In the case of CSP, we don't have a process ID to use to communicate. Instead, we have to create a channel to the processes to allow incoming and outgoing communication. In this case, what we know that the receiver is the channel it uses to receive data:</p><p class="calibre10">

</p><p class="calibre10">In this diagram, we can see that the processes are anonymous, but we have a channel with ID 1, that is, <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Channel 1</strong></span>, which connects them together. This abstraction does not tell us how many processes are on each side of the channel; it simply connects them and allows communication between processes by using the channel.</p><p class="calibre10">The key here is that channels isolate both extremes so that process A can send data through a channel that will be handled by potentially one or more processes that' are transparent to A. It also works the same in reverse; process B can receive data from many channels one at a time.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
