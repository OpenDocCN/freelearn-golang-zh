Think back to the first few chapter, when we explained the singleton pattern-it was some structure or variable that could only exist once in our code. All access to this structure should be done using the pattern described, but, in fact, it wasn't concurrent safe.</p><p class="calibre10">Now we will write with concurrency in mind. We will write a concurrent counter, like the one we wrote in the <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">mutexes</em></span> section, but this time we will solve it with channels.</p></div></body></html>
