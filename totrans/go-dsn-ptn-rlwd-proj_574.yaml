- en: Now that we know how to create Goroutines and channels, we'll put all our knowledge
    in a single package. Think back to the first few chapter, when we explained the
    singleton pattern-it was some structure or variable that could only exist once
    in our code. All access to this structure should be done using the pattern described,
    but, in fact, it wasn't concurrent safe.

    like the one we wrote in the *mutexes* section, but this time we will solve it
    with channels.
