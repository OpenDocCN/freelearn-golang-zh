In this chapter we'll see the following patterns:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Barrier is a very common pattern, especially when we have to wait for more than one response from different Goroutines before letting the program continue</li><li class="listitem">Future pattern allows us to write an algorithm that will be executed eventually in time (or not) by the same Goroutine or a different one</li><li class="listitem">Pipeline is a powerful pattern to build complex synchronous flows of Goroutines that are connected with each other according to some logic</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">Take a quick look at the description of the three patterns. They all describe some sort of logic to synchronize execution in time. It's very important to keep in mind that we are now developing concurrent structures with all the tools and patterns we have seen in the previous chapters. With Creational patterns we were dealing with creating objects. With the Structural patterns we were learning how to build idiomatic structures and in Behavioral patterns we were managing mostly with algorithms. Now, with Concurrency patterns, we will mostly manage the timing execution and order execution of applications that has more than one <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">flow</em></span>.</p></div></body></html>
