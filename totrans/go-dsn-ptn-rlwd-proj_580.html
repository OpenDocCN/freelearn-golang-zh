This is where the Barrier pattern can help us.</p><p class="calibre10">Our Barrier pattern could be a service that will block its response until it has been composed with the results returned by one or more different Goroutines (or services). And what kind of primitive do we have that has a blocking nature? Well, we can use a lock, but it's more idiomatic in Go to use an unbuffered channel.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
