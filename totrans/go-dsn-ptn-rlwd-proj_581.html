The Barrier pattern's objectives are as follows:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Compose the value of a type with the data coming from one or more Goroutines.</li><li class="listitem">Control the correctness of any of those incoming data pipes so that no inconsistent data is returned. We don't want a partially filled result because one of the pipes has returned an error.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>
