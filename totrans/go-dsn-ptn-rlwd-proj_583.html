These are a couple of public endpoints that respond with data from the incoming connections. They are very popular for testing purposes. You will need an internet connection to do this exercise.</li><li class="listitem">If any of the calls fails, it must not print any result-just the error message (or error messages if both calls failed).</li><li class="listitem">The output must be printed as a composed result when both calls have finished. It means that we cannot print the result of one call and then the other.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>
