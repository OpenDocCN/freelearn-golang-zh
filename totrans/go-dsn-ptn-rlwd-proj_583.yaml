    and `http://httpbin.org/User-Agent` URLs. These are a couple of public endpoints
    that respond with data from the incoming connections. They are very popular for
    testing purposes. You will need an internet connection to do this exercise.

    (or error messages if both calls failed).

- en: The output must be printed as a composed result when both calls have finished.
    It means that we cannot print the result of one call and then the other.
