It could be considered a Structural pattern, as you can imagine.</p><p class="calibre10">The Barrier pattern is not only useful to make network requests; we could also use it to split some task into multiple Goroutines. For example, an expensive operation could be split into a few smaller operations distributed in different Goroutines to maximize parallelism and achieve better performance.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
