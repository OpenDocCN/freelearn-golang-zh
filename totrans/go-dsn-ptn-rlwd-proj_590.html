In this example, we will have a method that returns a string or an error, but we want to execute it concurrently. We have learned ways to do this already. Using a channel, we can launch a new Goroutine and handle the incoming result from the channel.</p><p class="calibre10">But in this case, we will have to handle the result (string or error), and we don't want this. Instead, we will define what to do in case of success and what to do in case of error and fire-and-forget the Goroutine.</p></div></div></body></html>
