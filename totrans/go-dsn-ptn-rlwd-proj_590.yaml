- en: We are going to develop a very simple example to try to understand how a Future
    works. In this example, we will have a method that returns a string or an error,
    but we want to execute it concurrently. We have learned ways to do this already.
    Using a channel, we can launch a new Goroutine and handle the incoming result
    from the channel.

    don't want this. Instead, we will define what to do in case of success and what
    to do in case of error and fire-and-forget the Goroutine.
