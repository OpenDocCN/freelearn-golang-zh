- en: We have seen a good way to achieve asynchronous programming by using a function
    type system. However, we could have done it without functions by setting an interface
    with `Success`, `Fail`, and `Execute` methods and the types that satisfy them,
    and using the Template pattern to execute them asynchronously, as we have previously
    seen in this chapter. It is up to you!
