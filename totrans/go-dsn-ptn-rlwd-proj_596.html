Every time that we write any function that performs some logic, we are writing a pipeline: If <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">this</em></span> then <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">that</em></span>, or else <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">something else</em></span>. Pipelines pattern can be made more complex by using a few functions that call to each other. They can even get looped in theirÂ out execution.</p><p class="calibre10">The Pipeline pattern in Go works in a similar fashion, but each step in the Pipeline will be in a different Goroutine and communication, and synchronizing will be done using channels.</p></div></div></body></html>
