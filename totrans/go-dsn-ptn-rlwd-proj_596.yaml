    performs some logic, we are writing a pipeline: If *this* then *that*, or else
    *something else*. Pipelines pattern can be made more complex by using a few functions
    that call to each other. They can even get looped in theirÂ out execution.'

    Pipeline will be in a different Goroutine and communication, and synchronizing
    will be done using channels.
