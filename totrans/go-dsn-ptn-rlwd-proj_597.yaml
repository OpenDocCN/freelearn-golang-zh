- en: However, just because we decompose an algorithm in different Goroutines doesn't
    necessarily mean that it will execute the fastest. We are constantly talking about
    CPUs, so ideally the algorithm must be CPU-intensive to take advantage of a concurrent
    structure. The overhead of creating Goroutines and channels could make an algorithm
    smaller.
