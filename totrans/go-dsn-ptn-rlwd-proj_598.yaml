- en: We are going to do some math for our example. We are going to generate a list
    of numbers starting with 1 and ending at some arbitrary number N. Then we will
    take each number, power it to 2, and sum the resulting numbers to a unique result.
    So, if *N=3*, our list will be [1,2,3]. After powering them to 2, our list becomes
    [1,4,9]. If we sum the resulting list, the resulting value is 14.
