- en: Concurrency design patterns are a step forward in difficulty, and take some
    time to grasp. Our biggest mistake as concurrent programmers is thinking in terms
    of parallelism (How can I make this parallel? or How can I run this in a new thread?)
    instead of in terms of concurrent structures.

    same input) without affecting anything outside their scope) help in this design.

- en: Concurrent programming requires practice and more practice. Go makes it easy
    once you understand the basic primitives. Diagrams can help you to understand
    the possible flow of data, but the best way of understanding it all is simply
    to practice.

- en: In the following chapter, we will see how to use a pool of pipeline workers
    to do some work instead of having a unique pipeline. Also, we will learn how to
    create the publish/subscriber pattern in a concurrent structure and see how different
    the same pattern can be when we build by using concurrency.
