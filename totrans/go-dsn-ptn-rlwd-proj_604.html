We are using channels and Goroutines heavily, instead of locks or sharing variables.</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">We will look at one way to develop a pool of workers.

Chapter 7</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Behavioral Patterns - Visitor, State, Mediator, and Observer Design Patterns</em></span>, written with a concurrent structure. With this example we'll dig a bit more into the concurrent structures and look at how they can differ from a common approach.</li></ul></div></div></body></html>
