Now we will launch a bounded number of them so that the Go scheduler can try to process requests in parallel. The idea here is to control the number of Goroutines, stop them gracefully when the app has finished, and maximize parallelism using a concurrent structure without race conditions.</p><p class="calibre10">The pipeline we will use is similar to the one we used in the previous chapter, where we were generating numbers, raising them to the power of 2, and summing the final results. In this case, we are going to pass strings to which we will append and prefix data.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
