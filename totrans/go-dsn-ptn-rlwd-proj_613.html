It also has room to improve, but it is a very good design pattern to build concurrent bounded apps.</p><p class="calibre10">It is key that we always have the number of Goroutines that are being launched under control. While it's easy to launch thousands to achieve more parallelism in an app, we must be very careful that they don't have code that can hang them in an infinite loop, too.</p><p class="calibre10">With the workers pool, we can now fragment a simple operation in many parallel tasks. Think about it; this could achieve the same result with one simple call to <code class="email">fmt.Printf</code>, but we have done a pipeline with it; then, we launched few instances of this pipeline and finally, distributed the workload between all those pipes.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
