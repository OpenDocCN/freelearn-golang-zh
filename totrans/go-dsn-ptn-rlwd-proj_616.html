The difference here is the way we will develop it. The idea is to make a concurrent structure to achieve the same functionality, which isÂ as follows:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Providing an event-driven architecture where one event can trigger one or more actions</li><li class="listitem">Uncoupling the actions that are performed from the event that triggers them</li><li class="listitem">Providing more than one source event that triggers the same action</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">The idea is to uncouple senders from receivers, hiding from the sender the identity of the receivers that will process its event, and hiding the receivers from the number of senders that can communicate with them.</p><p class="calibre10">In particular, if I develop a click in a button in some application, it could do something (such as log us in somewhere). Weeks later, we might decide to make it show a popup, too. If, every time we want to add some functionality to this button, we have to change the code where it handles the click action, that function will become huge and not very portable to other projects. If we use a publisher and one observer for every action, the click function only needs to publish one single event using a publisher, and we will just write subscribers to this event every time we want to improve the functionality. This is especially important in applications with user interfaces where many things to do in a single UI action can slow the responsiveness of an interface, completely destroying the user experience.</p><p class="calibre10">By using a concurrent structure to develop the Observer pattern, a UI cannot feel all the tasks that are being executed in the background if a concurrent structure is defined and the device allows us to execute parallel tasks.</p></div></div></body></html>
