<span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">, Behavioral patterns - Visitor, State, Mediator, and Observer Design Patterns</em></span> must not change. The objective in both examples is the same so the requirements must also be the same. In this case, our requirements are technical, so we actually need to add some more acceptance criteria:</p><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">We must have a publisher with a <code class="email">PublishingCh</code> method that returns a channel to send messages through and triggers a <code class="email">Notify</code> method on every observer subscribed.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">We must have a method to add new subscribers to the publisher.</li><li class="listitem" value="3">We must have a method to remove new subscribers from the publisher.</li><li class="listitem" value="4">We must have a method to stop a subscriber.</li><li class="listitem" value="5">We must have a method to stop a <code class="email">Publisher</code> interface that will also stop all subscribers.</li><li class="listitem" value="6">All inter Goroutine communication must be synchronized so that no Goroutine is locked waiting for a response. In such cases, an error is returned after the specified timeout period has passed.</li></ol><div class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre10">Well, these criteria seem quite daunting. We have left out some requirements that would add even more complexity, such as removing non-responding subscribers or checks to monitor that the publisher Goroutine is always on.</p></div></div></body></html>
