We have tried to show a few ways to solve the same problem, one without concurrency primitives and one with them. We have seen how different the publish/subscriber example written with a concurrent structure can be compared toÂ the classic one.</p><p class="calibre10">We have also seen how to build a concurrent operation using a pipeline and we have parallelize it by using a worker pool, a very common Go pattern to maximize parallelism.</p><p class="calibre10">Both examples were simple enough to grasp, while digging as much as possible in to the nature of the Go language instead of in the problem itself.</p></div></body></html>
