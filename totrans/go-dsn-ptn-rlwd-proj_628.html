The <code class="email">room</code> type will be responsible for managing client connections and routing messages in and out, while the <code class="email">client</code> type represents the connection to a single client.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Tip"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip10" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre10">Go refers to classes as types and instances of those classes as objects.</p></div><p class="calibre10">To manage our web sockets, we are going to use one of the most powerful aspects of the Go community open source third-party packages. Every day, new packages solving real-world problems are released, ready for you to use in your own projects, and they even allow you to add features, report and fix bugs, and get support.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Tip"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip11" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre10">It is often unwise to reinvent the wheel unless you have a very good reason. So before embarking on building a new package, it is worth searching for any existing projects that might have already solved your very problem. If you find one similar project that doesn't quite satisfy your needs, consider contributing to the project and adding features. Go has a particularly active open source community (remember that Go itself is open source) that is always ready to welcome new faces or avatars.</p></div><p class="calibre10">We are going to use Gorilla Project's <code class="email">websocket</code> package to handle our server-side sockets rather than write our own. If you're curious about how it works, head over to the project home page on GitHub, <a class="calibre1" href="https://github.com/gorilla/websocket">https://github.com/gorilla/websocket</a>, and browse the open source code.</p></div></body></html>
