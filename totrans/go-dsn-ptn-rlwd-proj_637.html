In other words, we are manually testing our code. This is fine for experimental projects such as our chat application or small projects that aren't expected to grow, but if our code is to have a longer life or be worked on by more than one person, manual testing of this kind becomes a liability. We are not going to tackle <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Test-driven Development</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">TDD</strong></span>) for our chat program, but we should explore another useful debugging technique called <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">tracing</strong></span>.</p><p class="calibre10">Tracing is a practice by which we log or print key steps in the flow of a program to make what is going on under the covers visible. In the previous section, we added aÂ <code class="email">log.Println</code> call to output the address that the chat program was binding to. In this section, we are going to formalize this and write our own complete tracing package.</p><p class="calibre10">We are going to explore TDD practices when writing our tracing code because TDD is a perfect example of a package that we are likely to reuse, add to, share, and hopefully, even open source.</p></div></body></html>
