Wherever possible, describing the basic building blocks of your packages using interfaces usually ends up paying dividends down the road, and this is where we will start for our tracing package.</p><p class="calibre10">Create a new file called <code class="email">tracer.go</code> inside the <code class="email">trace</code> folder and write the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">package trace 
// Tracer is the interface that describes an object capable of 
// tracing events throughout code. 
type Tracer interface { 
  Trace(...interface{}) 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">The first thing to notice is that we have defined our package as <code class="email">trace</code>.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note0020" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">While it is a good practice to have the folder name match the package name, Go tools do not enforce it, which means you are free to name them differently if it makes sense. Remember, when people import your package, they will type the name of the folder, and if suddenly a package with a different name is imported, it could get confusing.</p></div><p class="calibre10">Our <code class="email">Tracer</code> type (the capital <code class="email">T</code> means we intend this to be a publicly visible type) is an interface that describes a single method called <code class="email">Trace</code>. The <code class="email">...interface{}</code> argument type states that our <code class="email">Trace</code> method will accept zero or more arguments of any type. You might think that this is a redundant provision as the method should just take a single string (we want to just trace out some string of characters, don't we?). However, consider functions such as <code class="email">fmt.Sprint</code> and <code class="email">log.Fatal</code>, both of which follow a pattern littered throughout Go's standard library that provides a helpful shortcut when trying to communicate multiple things in one go. Wherever possible, we should follow such patterns and practices because we want our own APIs to be familiar and clear to the Go community.</p></div></div></body></html>
