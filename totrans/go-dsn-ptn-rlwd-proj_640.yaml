    are simply definitions that do not provide any implementation and so cannot be
    directly tested. But we are about to write a real implementation of a `Tracer`
    method, and we will indeed write the tests first.

    it will be executed when we run our tests. To run them for this package, navigate

    confusing previous runs with the most recent one. On Windows, you can use the `cls`

    so you can add an `import` statement for the appropriate package in order to access
    the package. Others are external, and that's when you need to use `go get` to
    download them before they can be imported. For this case, you'll need to add `import
    "bytes"` to the top of the file.

    to be able to capture the output of our tracer in a `bytes.Buffer` variable so
    that we can then ensure that the string in the buffer matches the expected value.
    If it does not, a call to `t.Errorf` will fail the test. Before that, we check
    to make sure the return from a made-up `New` function is not `nil`; again, if
    it is, the test will fail because of the call to `t.Error`.

- en: Running `go test` now actually produces an error; it complains that there is
    no `New` function. We haven't made a mistake here; we are following a practice
    known as red-green testing. Red-green testing proposes that we first write a unit
    test, see it fail (or produce an error), write the minimum amount of code possible
    to make that test pass, and rinse and repeat it again. The key point here being
    that we want to make sure the code we add is actually doing something as well
    as ensuring that the test code we write is testing something meaningful.

    conditions would mean that such a test can indeed fail (like when the code being
    tested is misbehaving) at this point, you have a meaningful test that is worth
    contributing to the code base.
