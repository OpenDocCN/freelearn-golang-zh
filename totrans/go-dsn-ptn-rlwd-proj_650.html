Even if you do not wish to access the private data, OAuth2 is a great option that allows people to sign in using their existing credentials, without exposing those credentials to a third-party site. In this case, we are the third party, and we want to allow our users to sign in using services that support OAuth2.</p><p class="calibre10">From a user's point of view, the OAuth2 flow is as follows:</p><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">The user selects the provider with whom they wish to sign in to the client app.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">The user is redirected to the provider's website (with a URL that includes the client app ID) where they are asked to give permission to the client app.</li><li class="listitem" value="3">The user signs in from the OAuth2 service provider and accepts the permissions requested by the third-party application.</li><li class="listitem" value="4">The user is redirected to the client app with a request code.</li><li class="listitem" value="5">In the background, the client app sends the grant code to the provider, who sends back an authentication token.</li><li class="listitem" value="6">The client app uses the access token to make authorized requests to the provider, such as to get user information or wall posts.</li></ol><div class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre10">To avoid reinventing the wheel, we will look at a few open source projects that have already solved this problem for us.</p></div></body></html>
