- en: OAuth2 is an open authorization standard designed to allow resource owners to
    give clients delegated access to private data (such as wall posts or tweets) via
    an access token exchange handshake. Even if you do not wish to access the private
    data, OAuth2 is a great option that allows people to sign in using their existing
    credentials, without exposing those credentials to a third-party site. In this
    case, we are the third party, and we want to allow our users to sign in using
    services that support OAuth2.
