- en: Andrew Gerrand has been working on the core Go team since February 2010, that
    is, two years before Go 1.0 was officially released. His `goauth2` package (see
    [https://github.com/golang/oauth2](https://github.com/golang/oauth2)) is an elegant
    implementation of the OAuth2 protocol written entirely in Go.

- en: Andrew's project inspired `gomniauth` (see [https://github.com/stretchr/gomniauth](https://github.com/stretchr/gomniauth)).
    An open source Go alternative to Ruby's `omniauth` project, `gomniauth` provides
    a unified solution to access different OAuth2 services. In the future, when OAuth3
    (or whatever the next-generation authorization protocol will be) comes out, in
    theoryÂ `gomniauth` could take on the pain of implementing the details, leaving
    the user code untouched.

    so you'll need to head over to [http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com](http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com)
    to download them.
