Most providers have some kind of web tool or console where you can create applications to kick this process off. Here's one from Google:</p><p class="calibre10">

</p><p class="calibre10">In order to identify the client application, we need to create a client ID and secret. Despite the fact that OAuth2 is an open standard, each provider has their own language and mechanism to set things up. Therefore, you will most likely have to play around with the user interface or the documentation to figure it out in each case.</p><p class="calibre10">At the time of writing, in <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Google Cloud Console</strong></span>, you navigate to <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">API Manager</strong></span> and click on the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Credentials</strong></span> section.</p><p class="calibre10">In most cases, for added security, you have to be explicit about the host URLs from where requests will come. For now, since we're hosting our app locally on <code class="email">localhost:8080</code>, you should use it. You will also be asked for a redirect URI that is the endpoint in our chat application and to which the user will be redirected after they successfully sign in. The callback will be another action in <code class="email">loginHandler</code>, so the redirect URL for the Google client will be <code class="email">http://localhost:8080/auth/callback/google</code>.</p><p class="calibre10">Once you finish the authorization process for the providers you want to support, you will be given a client ID and secret for each provider. Make a note of these details because we will need them when we set up the providers in our chat application.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note0031" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">If we host our application on a real domain, we have to create new client IDs and secrets or update the appropriate URL fields on our authorization providers to ensure that they point to the right place. Either way, it is good practice to have a different set of development and production keys for security.</p></div></div></body></html>
