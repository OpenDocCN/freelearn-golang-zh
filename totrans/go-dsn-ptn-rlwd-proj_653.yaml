    you noted down earlier. The third argument represents the callback URL that should
    match the ones you provided when creating your clients on the provider's website.
    Notice the second path segment is `callback`; while we haven't implemented this
    yet, this is where we handle the response from the authorization process.

- en: Gomniauth requires the `SetSecurityKey` call because it sends state data between
    the client and server along with a signature checksum, which ensures that the
    state values are not tempered with while being transmitted. The security key is
    used when creating the hash in a way that it is almost impossible to recreate
    the same hash without knowing the exact security key. You should replace `some
    long key` with a security hash or phrase of your choice.
