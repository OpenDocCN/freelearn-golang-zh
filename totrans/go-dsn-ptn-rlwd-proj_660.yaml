- en: It turns out that most auth servers already have images for their users, and
    they make them available through the protected user resource that we already used
    in order to get our user's names. To use this avatar picture, we need to get the
    URL from the provider, store it in the cookie for our user, and send it through
    a web socket so that every client can render the picture alongside the corresponding
    message.
