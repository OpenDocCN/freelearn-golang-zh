- en: All we have done here is take the value from the `userData` field that represents
    what we put into the cookie and assigned it to the appropriate field in `message`
    if the value was present in the map. We now take the additional step of checking
    whether the value is present because we cannot guarantee that the auth service
    would provide a value for this field. And since it could be `nil`, it might cause
    panic to assign it to a `string` type if it's actually missing.
