    about it. In the previous chapter, we implemented the Bootstrap library into our
    login page, and we are going to extend its use to our chat page now. We will make
    three changes in `chat.html`: include Bootstrap and tweak the CSS styles for our
    page, change the markup for our form, and tweak how we render messages on the
    page:'

    items; for example, the form-control class neatly formats elements within form
    (you can check out the Bootstrap documentation for more information on what these
    classes do).
