- en: Gravatar is a web service that allows users to upload a single profile picture
    and associate it with their e-mail address in order to make it available from
    any website. Developers, like us, can access these images for our application
    just by performing a `GET` operation on a specific API endpoint. In this section,
    we will look at how to implement Gravatar rather than use the picture provided
    by the auth service.
