- en: In the third and final approach of uploading a picture, we will look at how
    to allow users to upload an image from their local hard drive to use as their
    profile picture when chatting. The file will then be served to the browsers via
    a URL. We will need a way to associate a file with a particular user to ensure
    that we associate the right picture with the corresponding messages.
