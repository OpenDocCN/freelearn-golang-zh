- en: We used Bootstrap again to make our page look nice and also to make it fit in
    with the other pages. However, the key point to note here is the HTML form that
    will provide the user interface required to upload files. The action points to
    `/uploader`, the handler for which we have yet to implement, and the `enctype`
    attribute must be `multipart/form-data` so that the browser can transmit binary
    data over HTTP. Then, there is an `input` element of the type `file`, which will
    contain a reference to the file we want to upload. Also, note that we have included
    the `userid` value from the `UserData` map as a hidden input this will tell us
    which user is uploading a file. It is important that the `name` attributes be
    correct, as this is how we will refer to the data when we implement our handler
    on the server.
