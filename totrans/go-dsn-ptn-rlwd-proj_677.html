Before we invite our friends to join the conversation, we need to pick a valid, catchy, and available domain name, which we can point to the server running our Go code. Instead of sitting in front of our favorite domain name provider for hours on end trying different names, we are going to develop a few command-line tools that will help us find the right one. As we do so, we will see how the Go standard library allows us to interface with the terminal and other executing applications; we'll also explore some patterns and practices to build command-line programs.</p><p class="calibre10">In this chapter, you will learn:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">How to build complete command-line applications with as little as a single code file</li><li class="listitem">How to ensure that the tools we build can be composed with other tools using standard streams</li><li class="listitem">How to interact with a simple third-party JSON RESTful API</li><li class="listitem">How to utilize the standard in and out pipes in Go code</li><li class="listitem">How to read from a streaming source, one line at a time</li><li class="listitem">How to build a WHOIS client to look up domain information</li><li class="listitem">How to store and use sensitive or deployment-specific information in environment variables</li></ul></div></div></body></html>
