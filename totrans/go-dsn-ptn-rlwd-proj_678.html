Each tool will take an input line by line via the standard input pipe, process it in some way, and then print the output line by line to the standard out pipe for the next tool or user.</p><p class="calibre10">By default, the standard input is connected to the user's keyboard, and the standard output is printed to the terminal from where the command was run; however, both can be redirected using <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">redirection metacharacters</strong></span>. It's possible to throw the output away by redirecting it to <code class="email">NUL</code> on Windows or <code class="email">/dev/null</code> on Unix machines, or redirecting it to a file that will cause the output to be saved to a disk. Alternatively, you can pipe (using the <code class="email">|</code> pipe character) the output of one program to the input of another; it is this feature that we will make use of in order to connect our various tools together. For example, you could pipe the output from one program to the input of another program in a terminal using this code:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">echo -n "Hello" | md5</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">The output of the <code class="email">echo</code> command will be the string <code class="email">Hello</code> (without the quotes), which is then <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">piped</strong></span> to the <code class="email">md5</code> command; this command will in turn calculate the MD5 hash of <code class="email">Hello</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">8b1a9953c4611296a827abf8c47804d7</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">Our tools will work with lines of strings where each line (separated by a linefeed character) represents one string. When run without any pipe redirection, we will be able to interact directly with the programs using the default in and out, which will be useful when testing and debugging our code.</p></div></div></body></html>
