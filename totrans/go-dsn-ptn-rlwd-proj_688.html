The system we will build in this chapter will prepare us for a future where all democratic elections happen online on Twitter, of course. Our solution will collect and count votes by querying Twitter's streaming API for mentions of specific hash tags, and each component will be capable of horizontally scaling to meet demand. Our use case is a fun and interesting one, but the core concepts we'll learn and the specific technology choices we'll make are the real focus of this chapter. The ideas discussed here are directly applicable to any system that needs true-scale capabilities.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note0072" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Horizontal scaling</strong></span> refers to adding nodes, such as physical machines, to a system in order to improve its availability, performance, and/or capacity. Big data companies such as Google can scale by adding affordable and easy-to-obtain hardware (commonly referred to as commodity hardware) due to the way they write their software and architect their solutions.</p><p class="calibre10"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Vertical scaling</strong></span> is synonymous to increasing the resource available to a single node, such as adding additional RAM to a box or a processor with more cores.</p></div><p class="calibre10">In this chapter, you will:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Learn about distributed <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">NoSQL</strong></span> datastores, specifically how to interact with MongoDB</li><li class="listitem">Learn about <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">distributed messaging queues</strong></span>, in our case, Bit.ly's NSQ and how to use the <code class="email">go-nsq</code> package to easily publish and subscribe to events</li><li class="listitem">Stream live tweet data through Twitter's streaming APIs and manage long running net connections</li><li class="listitem">Learn how to properly stop programs with many internal goroutines</li><li class="listitem">Learn how to use low memory channels for signaling</li></ul></div></div></body></html>
