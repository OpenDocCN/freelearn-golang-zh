- en: In this chapter, we will explore transferrable skills that allow us to use schemaless
    data and distributed technologies to solve big data problems. The system we will
    build in this chapter will prepare us for a future where all democratic elections
    happen online on Twitter, of course. Our solution will collect and count votes
    by querying Twitter's streaming API for mentions of specific hash tags, and each
    component will be capable of horizontally scaling to meet demand. Our use case
    is a fun and interesting one, but the core concepts we'll learn and the specific
    technology choices we'll make are the real focus of this chapter. The ideas discussed
    here are directly applicable to any system that needs true-scale capabilities.

    a system in order to improve its availability, performance, and/or capacity. Big
    data companies such as Google can scale by adding affordable and easy-to-obtain
    hardware (commonly referred to as commodity hardware) due to the way they write
    their software and architect their solutions.'

    a single node, such as adding additional RAM to a box or a processor with more
    cores.'
