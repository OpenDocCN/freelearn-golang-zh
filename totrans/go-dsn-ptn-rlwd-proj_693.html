Each document goes into a collection that can be used to group the documents together without enforcing any schema on the data inside them. Unlike rows in a traditional RDBMS, such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or MySQL, it is perfectly acceptable for documents to have a different shape. For example, a <code class="email">people</code> collection can contain the following three JSON documents at the same time:</p><pre class="programlisting">{"name":"Mat","lang":"en","points":57} 
{"name":"Laurie","position":"Scrum Master"} 
{"position":"Traditional Manager","exists":false} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">This flexibility allows data with varying structures to coexist without impacting performance or wasting space. It is also extremely useful if you expect your software to evolve over time, as we really always should.</p><p class="calibre10">MongoDB was designed to scale while also remaining very easy to work with on single-box installations, such as our development machine. When we host our application for production, we would most likely install a more complex multi-sharded, replicated system, which is distributed across many nodes and locations, but for now, just running <code class="email">mongod</code> will do.</p><p class="calibre10">Head over to <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads">http://www.mongodb.org/downloads</a> in order to grab the latest version of MongoDB and install it, making sure to register the <code class="email">bin</code> folder with your <code class="email">PATH</code> environment variable, as usual.</p><p class="calibre10">To validate that MongoDB is successfully installed, run the <code class="email">mongod</code> command, and then hit <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Ctrl + C</em></span> to stop it for now.</p><div class="book" title="MongoDB driver for Go"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch05lvl3sec0018" class="calibre1"/>MongoDB driver for Go</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">Gustavo Niemeyer has done a great job in simplifying interactions with MongoDB with his <code class="email">mgo</code> (pronounced <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">mango</em></span>) package hosted at <a class="calibre1" href="http://labix.org/mgo">http://labix.org/mgo</a>, which is <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">go gettable</em></span> with the following command:</p><pre class="programlisting">
