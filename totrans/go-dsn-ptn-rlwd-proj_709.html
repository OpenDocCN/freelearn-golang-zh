We also used the MongoDB shell to add polls and see the poll results. This approach is fine if we are the only ones using our solution, but it would be madness if we released our project and expected users to connect directly to our MongoDB instance in order to use the service we built.</p><p class="calibre10">Therefore, in this chapter, we are going to build a RESTful data service through which the data and functionality will be exposed. We will also put together a simple website that consumes the new API. Users may then either use our website to create and monitor polls or build their own application on top of the web services we release.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Tip"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip94" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre10">Code in this chapter depends on the code in <a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 5.  Building Distributed Systems and Working with Flexible Data" href="part0174_split_000.html#55U1S1-9c484ed022e64a0fb0e1aebf8e05d4fd">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Building Distributed Systems and Working with Flexible Data</em></span>, so it is recommended that you complete that chapter first, especially since it covers setting up the environment that the code in this chapter runs on.</p></div><p class="calibre10">Specifically, you will learn:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">How wrapping <code class="email">http.HandlerFunc</code> types can give us a simple but powerful pipeline of execution for our HTTP requests</li><li class="listitem">How to safely share data between HTTP handlers using the <code class="email">context</code> package</li><li class="listitem">Best practices for the writing of handlers responsible for exposing data</li><li class="listitem">Where small abstractions can allow us to write the simplest possible implementations now but leave room to improve them later without changing the interface</li><li class="listitem">How adding simple helper functions and types to our project will prevent us from (or at least defer) adding dependencies on external packages</li></ul></div></div></body></html>
