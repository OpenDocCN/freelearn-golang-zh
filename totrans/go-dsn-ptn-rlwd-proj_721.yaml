- en: The final piece of the puzzle is the `handlePolls` function, which will use
    the helpers to understand the incoming request and access the database and generate
    a meaningful response that will be sent back to the client. We also need to model
    the poll data that we were working with in the previous chapter.

- en: Here, we define a structure called `poll`, which has five fields that in turn
    describe the polls being created and maintained by the code we wrote in the previous
    chapter. We have also added the `APIKey` field, which you probably wouldn't do
    in the real world but which will allow us to demonstrate how we extract the API
    key from the context. Each field also has a tag (two in the `ID` case), which
    allows us to provide some extra metadata.
