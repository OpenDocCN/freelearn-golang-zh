We will give our project the codename Meander.</p><p class="calibre10">Often on projects in the real world, you are not responsible for the full stack; somebody else builds the website, a different person might write the iOS app, and maybe an outsourced company builds the desktop version. On more successful API projects, you might not even know who the consumers of your API are, especially if it's a public API.</p><p class="calibre10">In this chapter, we will simulate this reality by designing and agreeing a minimal API design with a fictional partner up front before going on to implement the API. Once we have finished our side of the project, we will download a user interface built by our teammates to see the two work together to produce the final application.</p><p class="calibre10">In this chapter, you will:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Learn to express the general goals of a project using short and simple Agile user stories</li><li class="listitem">Discover that you can agree on a meeting point in a project by agreeing on the design of an API, which allows many people to work in parallel</li><li class="listitem">See how early versions can have data fixtures written in code and compiled into the program, allowing us to change the implementation later without touching the interface</li><li class="listitem">Learn a strategy that allows structs (and other types) to represent a public version of themselves for cases where we want to hide or transform internal representations</li><li class="listitem">Learn to use embedded structs to represent nested data while keeping the interface of our types simple</li><li class="listitem">Learn to use <code class="email">http.Get</code> to make external API requests, specifically to the Google Places API, with no code bloat</li><li class="listitem">Learn to effectively implement enumerators in Go even though they aren't really a language feature</li><li class="listitem">Experience a real-world example of TDD</li><li class="listitem">Look at how the <code class="email">math/rand</code> package makes it easy to select an item from a slice at random</li><li class="listitem">Learn an easy way to grab data from the URL parameters of the <code class="email">http.Request</code> type</li></ul></div></div></body></html>
