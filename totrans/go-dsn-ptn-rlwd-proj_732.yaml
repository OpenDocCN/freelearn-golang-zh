- en: Following Agile methodologies, let's write two user stories that describe the
    functionality of our project. User stories shouldn't be comprehensive documents
    describing the entire set of features of an application; rather, small cards are
    perfect for not only describing what the user is trying to do, but also why. Also,
    we should do this without trying to design the whole system up front or delving
    too deep into implementation details.

    provide and actually ends up representing two endpoints.

- en: In order to discover places around specified locations, we are going to make
    use of the Google Places API, which allows us to search for listings of businesses
    with given types, such as `bar`, `cafe`, or `movie_theater`. We will then use
    Go's `math/rand` package to pick from these places at random, building up a complete
    journey for our users.
