- en: This handler is responsible for preparing the `meander.Query` object and calling
    its `Run` method before responding with the results. The `http.Request` type's
    URL value exposes the `Query` data that provides a `Get` method which, in turn,
    looks up a value for a given key.

- en: The journey string is translated from the `bar|cafe|movie_theater` format to
    a slice of strings by splitting on the pipe character. Then, a few calls to functions
    in the `strconv` package turn the string latitude, longitude, and radius values
    into numerical types. If the values are in an incorrect format, we will get an
    error, which we will then write out to the client using the `http.Error` helper
    with an `http.StatusBadRequest` status.
