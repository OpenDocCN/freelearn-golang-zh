    `cmd/meander`Â folder. Because our program imports the `meander` package, building
    the program will automatically build our `meander` package too.

    latitude and longitude. Head over to [http://mygeoposition.com/](http://mygeoposition.com/)
    and use the web tools to get the `x,y` values for a location you are familiar
    with.

    simple API is by trying various journey strings, tweaking the locations, and trying
    different cost range value strings.

    and point it at our implementation to see it come to life before our eyes. Head
    over to [https://github.com/matryer/goblueprints/tree/master/chapter7/meanderweb](https://github.com/matryer/goblueprints/tree/master/chapter7/meanderweb)
    and download the `meanderweb` project into your `GOPATH` folder (alongside your
    root meander folder will do).

    look for the API running at `localhost:8080`. Because we added the CORS support,
    this won't be a problem despite them running on different domains.

    while somebody else built the UI, it would be pretty useless without the API that
    we built in order to power it.
