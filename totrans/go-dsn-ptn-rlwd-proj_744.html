In order to parallelize the project, we agreed upon the meeting point of the project as the API design, and we built toward it (as would our partners).</p><p class="calibre10">We embedded data directly in the code, avoiding the need to investigate, design, and implement a data store in the early stages of a project. By caring about how that data is accessed (via the API endpoint) instead, we allowed our future selves to completely change how and where the data is stored without breaking any apps that have been written with our API.</p><p class="calibre10">We implemented the <code class="email">Facade</code> interface, which allows our structs and other types to provide public representations of them without revealing messy or sensitive details about our implementation.</p><p class="calibre10">Our foray into enumerators gave us a useful starting point to build enumerated types, even though there is no official support for them in the language. The <code class="email">iota</code> keyword that we used lets us specify constants of our own numerical type, with incrementing values. The common <code class="email">String</code> method that we implemented showed us how to make sure that our enumerated types don't become obscure numbers in our logs. At the same time, we also saw a real-world example of TDD and red/green programming, where we wrote unit tests that first fail but which we then go on to make pass by writing the implementation code.</p><p class="calibre10">In the next chapter, we are going to take a break from web services in order to build a backup tool for our code, where we'll explore how easy Go makes it for us to interact with the local filesystem.</p></div></body></html>
