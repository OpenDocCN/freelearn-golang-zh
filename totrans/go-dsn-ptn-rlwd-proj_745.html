These include everything from apps such as Dropbox, Box, and Carbonite to hardware solutions such as Apple's Time Machine, Seagate, or network-attached storage products, to name a few. Most consumer tools provide some key automatic functionality, along with an app or website for you to manage your policies and content. Often, especially for developers, these tools don't quite do the things we need them to. However, thanks to Go's standard library (which includes packages such as <code class="email">ioutil</code> and <code class="email">os</code>), we have everything we need to build a backup solution that behaves exactly the way we need it to.</p><p class="calibre10">For our next project, we will build a simple filesystem backup for our source code projects that archive specified folders and save a snapshot of them every time we make a change. The change could be when we tweak a file and save it, when we add new files and folders, or even when we delete a file. We want to be able to go back to any point in time to retrieve old files.</p><p class="calibre10">Specifically, in this chapter, you will learn about the following topics:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">How to structure projects that consist of packages and command-line tools</li><li class="listitem">A pragmatic approach to persisting simple data across tool executions</li><li class="listitem">How the <code class="email">os</code> package allows you to interact with a filesystem</li><li class="listitem">How to run code in an infinite timed loop while respecting <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Ctrl + C</em></span></li><li class="listitem">How to use <code class="email">filepath.Walk</code> to iterate over files and folders</li><li class="listitem">How to quickly determine whether the contents of a directory have changed</li><li class="listitem">How to use the <code class="email">archive/zip</code> package to zip files</li><li class="listitem">How to build tools that care about a combination of command-line flags and normal arguments</li></ul></div></div></body></html>
