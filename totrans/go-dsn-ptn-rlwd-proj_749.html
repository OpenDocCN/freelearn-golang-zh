We don't want to over-abstract or waste too much time upfront designing something that we know will change as we start to code, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't look for obvious concepts that are worth pulling out. If you're not sure, that is perfectly acceptable; you should write your code using concrete types and revisit potential abstractions after you have actually solved the problems.</p><p class="calibre10">However, since our code will archive files, the <code class="email">Archiver</code> interface pops out as a candidate.</p><p class="calibre10">Create a new folder inside your <code class="email">GOPATH/src</code> folderÂ called <code class="email">backup</code>, and add the following <code class="email">archiver.go</code> code:</p><pre class="programlisting">package backup 
type Archiver interface { 
  Archive(src, dest string) error 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">An <code class="email">Archiver</code> interface will specify a method called <code class="email">Archive</code>, which takes source and destination paths and returns an error. Implementations of this interface will be responsible for archiving the source folder and storing it in the destination path.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note00123" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">Defining an interface up front is a nice way to get some concepts out of our heads and into the code; it doesn't mean that this interface can't change as we evolve our solution as long as we remember the power of simple interfaces. Also, remember that most of the I/O interfaces in the <code class="email">io</code> package expose only a single method.</p></div><p class="calibre10">From the very beginning, we have made the case that while we are going to implement ZIP files as our archive format, we could easily swap this out later with another kind of <code class="email">Archiver</code> format.</p></div></div></body></html>
