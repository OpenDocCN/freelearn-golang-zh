- en: The first of two tools we will build allows the user to add, list, and remove
    paths for the backup daemon tool (which we will write later). You can expose a
    web interface or even use the binding packages for the desktop user interface
    integration, but we are going to keep things simple and build ourselves a command-line
    tool.

- en: Create a new folder called `cmds` inside the `backup` folder and create another
    `backup` folder inside that so you have `backup/cmds/backup`.

- en: We first define our `fatalErr` variable and defer the function that checks to
    ensure that value is `nil`. If it is not, it will print the error along with flag
    defaults and exit with a nonzero status code. We then define a flag called `db`
    that expects the path to the `filedb` database directory before parsing the flags
    and getting the remaining arguments and ensuring that there is at least one.
