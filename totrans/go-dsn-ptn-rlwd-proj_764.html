Google's architecture runs some of the biggest applications in the world, such as Google Search, Google Maps, and Gmail, among others, so is a pretty safe bet when it comes to deploying our own code.</p><p class="calibre10">Google App Engine allows you to write a Go application, add a few special configuration files, and deploy it to Google's servers, where it will be hosted and made available in a highly available, scalable, and elastic environment. Instances will automatically spin up to meet demand and tear down gracefully when they are no longer needed with a healthy free quota and preapproved budgets.</p><p class="calibre10">Along with running application instances, Google App Engine makes available a myriad of useful services, such as fast and high-scale data stores, search, memcache, and task queues. Transparent load balancing means you don't need to build and maintain additional software or hardware to ensure servers don't get overloaded and that requests are fulfilled quickly.</p><p class="calibre10">In this chapter, we will build the API backend for a question and answer service similar to Stack Overflow or Quora and deploy it to Google App Engine. In the process, we'll explore techniques, patterns, and practices that can be applied to all such applications, as well as dive deep into some of the more useful services available to our application.</p><p class="calibre10">Specifically, in this chapter, you will learn:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">How to use the Google App Engine SDK for Go to build and test applications locally before deploying to the cloud</li><li class="listitem">How to use <code class="email">app.yaml</code> to configure your application</li><li class="listitem">How Modules in Google App Engine let you independently manage the different components that make up your application</li><li class="listitem">How the Google Cloud Datastore lets you persist and query data at scale</li><li class="listitem">A sensible pattern for the modeling of data and working with keys in Google Cloud Datastore</li><li class="listitem">How to use the Google App Engine Users API to authenticate people with Google accounts</li><li class="listitem">A pattern to embed denormalized data into entities</li><li class="listitem">How to ensure data integrity and build counters using transactions</li><li class="listitem">Why maintaining a good line of sight in code helps improve maintainability</li><li class="listitem">How to achieve simple HTTP routing without adding a dependency to a third-party package</li></ul></div></div></body></html>
