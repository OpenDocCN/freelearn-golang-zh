- en: Google App Engine gives developers a **NoOps** (short for **No Operations**,
    indicating that developers and engineers have no work to do in order to have their
    code running and available) way of deploying their applications, and Go has been
    officially supported as a language option for some years now. Google's architecture
    runs some of the biggest applications in the world, such as Google Search, Google
    Maps, and Gmail, among others, so is a pretty safe bet when it comes to deploying
    our own code.

- en: Google App Engine allows you to write a Go application, add a few special configuration
    files, and deploy it to Google's servers, where it will be hosted and made available
    in a highly available, scalable, and elastic environment. Instances will automatically
    spin up to meet demand and tear down gracefully when they are no longer needed
    with a healthy free quota and preapproved budgets.

- en: Along with running application instances, Google App Engine makes available
    a myriad of useful services, such as fast and high-scale data stores, search,
    memcache, and task queues. Transparent load balancing means you don't need to
    build and maintain additional software or hardware to ensure servers don't get
    overloaded and that requests are fulfilled quickly.

    similar to Stack Overflow or Quora and deploy it to Google App Engine. In the
    process, we'll explore techniques, patterns, and practices that can be applied
    to all such applications, as well as dive deep into some of the more useful services
    available to our application.
