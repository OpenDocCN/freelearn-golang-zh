In a browser, go to <a class="calibre1" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">https://console.cloud.google.com</a> and sign in with your Google account. Look for the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Create Project</strong></span> menu item, which often gets moved around as the console changes from time to time. If you already have some projects, click on a project name to open a submenu, and you'll find it in there.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Tip"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip134" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre10">If you can't find what you're looking for, just search <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Creating App Engine project</strong></span> and you'll find it.</p></div><p class="calibre10">When the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">New Project</strong></span> dialog box opens, you will be asked for a name for your application. You are free to call it whatever you like (for example, Answers), but note the Project ID that is generated for you; you will need to refer to this when you configure your app later. You can also click on <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Edit</strong></span> and specify your own ID, but know that the value must be globally unique, so you'll have to get creative when thinking one up. In this book, we will use <code class="email">answersapp</code> as the application ID, but you won't be able to use that one since it has already been taken.</p><p class="calibre10">You may need to wait a minute or two for your project to get created; there's no need to watch the page you can continue and check back later.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
