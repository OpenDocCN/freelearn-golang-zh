- en: In order to deploy an application to Google's servers, we must use the Google
    Cloud Platform Console to set it up. In a browser, go to [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    and sign in with your Google account. Look for the **Create Project** menu item,
    which often gets moved around as the console changes from time to time. If you
    already have some projects, click on a project name to open a submenu, and you'll
    find it in there.

- en: When the **New Project** dialog box opens, you will be asked for a name for
    your application. You are free to call it whatever you like (for example, Answers),
    but note the Project ID that is generated for you; you will need to refer to this
    when you configure your app later. You can also click on **Edit** and specify
    your own ID, but know that the value must be globally unique, so you'll have to
    get creative when thinking one up. In this book, we will use `answersapp` as the
    application ID, but you won't be able to use that one since it has already been
    taken.
