- en: In Google App Engine, an application is just a normal Go package with an `init`
    function that registers handlers via the `http.Handle` or `http.HandleFunc` functions.
    It does not need to be the `main` package like normal tools.

- en: You will be familiar with most of this by now, but note that there is no `ListenAndServe`
    call, and the handlers are set inside the `init` function rather than `main`.
    We are going to handle every request with our simple `handleHello` function, which
    will just write a welcoming string.
