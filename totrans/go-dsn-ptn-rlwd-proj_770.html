Back in the terminal, stop the server by hitting <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Ctrl</em></span>+<span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">C</em></span> and run the following command:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">goapp deploy</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">Your application will be packaged and uploaded to Google's servers. Once it's finished, you should see something like the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Completed update of app: theanswersapp, version: 1</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">It really is as simple as that.</p><p class="calibre10">You can prove this by navigating to the endpoint you get for free with every Google App Engine application, remembering to replace the application ID with your own:Â <code class="email">https://YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE.appspot.com/</code>.</p><p class="calibre10">You will see the same output as earlier (the font may render differently since Google's servers will make assumptions about the content type that the local dev server doesn't).</p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note00135" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">The application is being served over HTTP/2 and is already capable of pretty massive scale, and all we did was write a <code class="email">config</code> file and a few lines of code.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
