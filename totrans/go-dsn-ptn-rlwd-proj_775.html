They can be made up of either a string or an integer depending on what makes sense for your case. You are free to decide the keys for yourself or let Datastore automatically assign them for you; again, your use case will usually decide which is the best approach to take and we'll explore both in this chapter.</p><p class="calibre10">Keys are created using theÂ <code class="email">datastore.NewKey</code> and <code class="email">datastore.NewIncompleteKey</code> functions and are used to put and get data into and out of Datastore via the <code class="email">datastore.Get</code> and <code class="email">datastore.Put</code> functions.</p><p class="calibre10">In Datastore, keys and entity bodies are distinct, unlike in MongoDB or SQL technologies, where it is just another field in the document or record. This is why we are excluding <code class="email">Key</code> from our <code class="email">Question</code> struct with the <code class="email">datastore:"-"</code> field tag. Like the <code class="email">json</code> tags, this indicates that we want Datastore to ignore the <code class="email">Key</code> field altogether when it is getting and putting data.</p><p class="calibre10">Keys may optionally have parents, which is a nice way of grouping associated data together and Datastore makes certain assurances about such groups of entities, which you can read more about in the Google Cloud Datastore documentation online.</p></div></div></body></html>
