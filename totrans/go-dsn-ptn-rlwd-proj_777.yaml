    since we want to maintain keys in our entities (and `datastore` methods don''t
    work like that), it''s common to add a helper function like the one we are going
    to add to `questions.go`:'

- en: The `GetQuestion` function takes `context.Context` and the `datastore.Key` method
    of the question to get. It then does the simple task of calling `datastore.Get`
    and assigning the key to the entity before returning it. Of course, errors are
    handled in the usual way.

- en: This is a nice pattern to follow so that users of your code know that they never
    have to interact with `datastore.Get` and `datastore.Put` directly but rather
    use the helpers that can ensure the entities are properly populated with the keys
    (along with any other tweaks that they might want to do before saving or after
    loading).
