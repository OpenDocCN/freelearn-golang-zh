However, it is worth resisting the temptation to do this right away because it is very easy to design a bad abstraction, which you are then stuck with since your code will start to depend on it. It is better to duplicate the code in a few places first and later revisit them to see whether a sensible abstraction is lurking there.</p></div></div></body></html>
