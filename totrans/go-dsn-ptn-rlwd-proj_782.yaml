- en: Copying and pasting is generally seen by programmers as a bad thing because
    it is usually possible to abstract the general idea and **DRY** (**Don't repeat
    yourself**) up the code. However, it is worth resisting the temptation to do this
    right away because it is very easy to design a bad abstraction, which you are
    then stuck with since your code will start to depend on it. It is better to duplicate
    the code in a few places first and later revisit them to see whether a sensible
    abstraction is lurking there.
