- en: Copying and pasting is generally seen by programmers as a bad thing because
    it is usually possible to abstract the general idea and **DRY** (**Don't repeat
    yourself**) up the code. However, it is worth resisting the temptation to do this
    right away because it is very easy to design a bad abstraction, which you are
    then stuck with since your code will start to depend on it. It is better to duplicate
    the code in a few places first and later revisit them to see whether a sensible
    abstraction is lurking there.

  zh: 复制粘贴通常被程序员视为不好的做法，因为这通常意味着可以抽象出一般想法并将代码**DRY**（**不要重复自己**）。然而，值得抵制立即这样做的诱惑，因为很容易设计出一个糟糕的抽象，然后你会陷入其中，因为你的代码将开始依赖于它。最好是先在几个地方复制代码，稍后再回过头来看是否有一个合理的抽象隐藏在那里。
