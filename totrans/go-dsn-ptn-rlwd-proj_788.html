But one nice feature about ancestor keys is that from the key alone, you can access the parent key. This is because the hierarchy of keys is maintained in the key itself, a bit like a path.</p><p class="calibre10">Three answers to question 1 might have these keys:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Question,1/Answer,1</li><li class="listitem">Question,1/Answer,2</li><li class="listitem">Question,1/Answer,3</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">The actual details of how keys work under the hood are kept internal to the datastore package and could change at any time. So it is smart to only rely on things that the API guarantees such as being able to access the parent via the <code class="email">Parent</code> method.</p></div></div></body></html>
