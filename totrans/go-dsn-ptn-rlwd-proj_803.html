In fact, we are able to add multiple options for our users and let them decide which one they want to use. We will add support the familiar JSON over HTTP, but we are also going to introduce a new technology choice for APIs.</p><p class="calibre10">gRPC, short for Google's <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Remote Procedure Call</strong></span>, is an open source mechanism used to call code that is running remotely over a network. It uses HTTP/2 for transport and protocol buffers to represent the data that makes up services and messages.</p><p class="calibre10">An RPC service differs from RESTful web services because rather than making changes to data using well-defined HTTP standards, as you do with REST (<code class="email">POST</code> to create something, <code class="email">PUT</code> to update something, <code class="email">DELETE</code> to delete something, and so on), you are triggering a remote function or method instead, passing in expected arguments and getting back one or more pieces of data in response.</p><p class="calibre10">To highlight the difference, imagine that we are creating a new user. In a RESTful world, we could make a request like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">POST /users 
{ 
  "name": "Mat", 
  "twitter": "@matryer" 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">And we might get a response like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">201 Created 
{ 
  "id": 1, 
  "name": "Mat", 
  "twitter": "@matryer" 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre10">RESTful calls represent queries or changes to the state of resources. In an RPC world, we would use generated code instead in order to make binary serialized procedure calls that feel much more like normal methods or functions in Go.</p><p class="calibre10">The only other key difference between a RESTful service and a gPRC service is that rather than JSON or XML, gPRC speaks a special format called <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">protocol buffers</strong></span>.</p></div></div></body></html>
