    end up increasing the quality and maintainability of your code. We are going to
    write a unit test that will use our new service to hash and then validate a password.

- en: We will create a new service via the `NewService` method and then use it to
    call the `Hash` and `Validate` methods. We even test an unhappy case, where we
    get the password wrong and ensure that `Validate` returns `false`â€“otherwise, it
    wouldn't be very secure at all.
