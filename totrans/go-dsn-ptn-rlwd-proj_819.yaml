- en: All the heavy lifting has already been done for us in our package code by Go
    kit, so we are left with simply calling the `NewHTTPServer` function, passing
    in the background context and the service endpoints we wish for it to expose,
    before calling the standard library's `http.ListenAndServe`, which exposes the
    handler functionality in the specified `httpAddr`. If an error occurs, we send
    it down the error channel.
