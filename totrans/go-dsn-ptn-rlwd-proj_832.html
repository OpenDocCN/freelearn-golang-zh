There is a lot of work involved without code generation, but the benefits for large teams and big micro-service architectures pay for the investment as you build self-similar, discrete components that make up the system.</p><p class="calibre10">We learned how gRPC and protocol buffers give us highly efficient transport communications between clients and servers. Using the <code class="email">proto3</code> language, we defined our service, including messages, and used the tools to generate a Go package that provided the client and server code for us.</p><p class="calibre10">We explored the fundamentals of Go kit and how we can use endpoints to describe the methods of our services. We let Go kit do the heavy lifting for us when it came to building HTTP and gRPC servers by making use of the packages included in the project. We saw how middleware functions let us easily adapt our endpoints to, among other things, rate limit the amount of traffic the server will have to handle.</p><p class="calibre10">We also learned about constructors in Go, a neat trick to parse incoming command-line arguments, and how to hash and validate passwords using the <code class="email">bcrypt</code> package, which is a sensible approach that helps us avoid storing passwords at all.</p><p class="calibre10">There is a lot more to building micro-services, and it is recommended that you head over to the Go kit website at <a class="calibre1" href="https://gokit.io">https://gokit.io</a> or join the conversation on the <code class="email">#go-kit</code> slack channel at gophers.slack.com to learn more.</p><p class="calibre10">Now that we have built our Vault service, we need to think about our options in order to deploy it into the wild. In the next chapter, we'll package our micro-service into a Docker container and deploy it to Digital Ocean's cloud.</p></div></body></html>
