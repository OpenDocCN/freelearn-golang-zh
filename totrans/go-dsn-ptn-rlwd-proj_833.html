This is useful when you consider that our development environment (perhaps a Mac) is different from a production environment (such as a Linux server or even a cloud service) and that there is a large number of different places that we might want to deploy the same application.</p><p class="calibre10">Most cloud platforms already support Docker, which makes it a great option to deploy our apps into the wild.</p><p class="calibre10">In <a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 9.  Building a Q&amp;A Application for Google App Engine" href="part0201_split_000.html#5VM122-9c484ed022e64a0fb0e1aebf8e05d4fd">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Building a Q&amp;A Application for Google App Engine</em></span>, we built an application for Google App Engine. We would need to make significant changes to our code if we decided that we wanted to run our application on a different platform even if we forget about our use of Google Cloud Datastore. Building applications with a mind to deploying them within Docker containers gives us an additional level of flexibility.</p><div class="informaltable" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note00178" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">Did you know that Docker itself was written in Go?
