- en: Docker is an open source ecosystem (technology and range of associated services)
    that allows you to package applications into containers that are simple, lightweight,
    and portable; they will run in the same way regardless of which environment they
    run on. This is useful when you consider that our development environment (perhaps
    a Mac) is different from a production environment (such as a Linux server or even
    a cloud service) and that there is a large number of different places that we
    might want to deploy the same application.

    deploy our apps into the wild.

    "Chapter 9.  Building a Q&A Application for Google App Engine"), *Building a Q&A
    Application for Google App Engine*, we built an application for Google App Engine.
    We would need to make significant changes to our code if we decided that we wanted
    to run our application on a different platform even if we forget about our use
    of Google Cloud Datastore. Building applications with a mind to deploying them
    within Docker containers gives us an additional level of flexibility.
