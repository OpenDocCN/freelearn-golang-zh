It makes deploying and serving Docker images very easy. In this section, we are going to deploy a droplet (Digital Ocean's terminology for a single machine) that runs our dockerized Vault service in the cloud.</p><p class="calibre10">Specifically, following are the steps to deploy Docker images to Digital Ocean:</p><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Create a droplet.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Gain access to it via a web-based console.</li><li class="listitem" value="3">Pull our <code class="email">USERNAME/vault</code> container.</li><li class="listitem" value="4">Run the container.</li><li class="listitem" value="5">Access our hosted Vault service remotely via the <code class="email">curl</code> command.</li></ol><div class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre10">Digital Ocean is a <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Platform as a Service</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">PaaS</strong></span>) architecture, and as such, the user experience is likely to change from time to time, so the exact flow described here might not be entirely accurate by the time you come to perform these tasks.
