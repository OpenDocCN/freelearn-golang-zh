    time of writing this, it is **Docker 1.12.1 on 16.04**, which means Docker version

    (the smallest size will do for now) and a location (pick the closest geographic
    location to you). We won't bother adding additional services (such as volumes,
    networking, or backups) for now just proceed with the simple droplet.

    you always do this.
