    that Digital Ocean has sent you. At the time of writing this, you cannot copy

    know which characters are likely to appear. For example, everything that looks
    like an *O* is probably *zero*, and *1* is unlikely to be an *I* or *L*.

    which involves typing the long generated password again! Security can be so inconvenient
    at times.
