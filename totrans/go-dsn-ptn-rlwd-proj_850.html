We created our Digital Ocean droplet using the helpful Docker app that they provide and controlled it via a web-based console. Once inside, we were able to pull our Docker image from the Docker Hub and run it inside our droplet.</p><p class="calibre10">Using the public IP of the droplet, we were then able to remotely access the Vault service's JSON/HTTP endpoint to hash and validate passwords.</p></div></body></html>
