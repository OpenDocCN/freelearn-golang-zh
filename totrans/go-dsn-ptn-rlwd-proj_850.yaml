- en: After installing the Docker tools, we saw how easy it was to package up our
    Go application into a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub. We created our Digital
    Ocean droplet using the helpful Docker app that they provide and controlled it
    via a web-based console. Once inside, we were able to pull our Docker image from
    the Docker Hub and run it inside our droplet.

    Vault service's JSON/HTTP endpoint to hash and validate passwords.
