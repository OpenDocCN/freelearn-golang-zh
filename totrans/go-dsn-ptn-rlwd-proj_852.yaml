- en: The best way to install Go is to use one of the many installers available online
    at [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/). Go to the Go website and
    click on **Download**, and then look for the latest 1.x version for your computer.
    The **Featured downloads** section at the top of the page contains links to the
    most popular versions, so yours will probably be in that list.

    work. For future versions of Go (2.0 and higher), you may need to tweak the code
    as major version releases may well contain breaking changes.
