<code class="email">GOPATH</code> is another environment variable to a folder (such as <code class="email">PATH</code> in the previous section) that is used to specify the location for the Go source code and the compiled binary packages. Using the <code class="email">import</code> command in your Go programs will cause the compiler to look in the <code class="email">GOPATH</code> location to find the packages you are referring to. When using <code class="email">go get</code> and other commands, projects are downloaded into the <code class="email">GOPATH</code> folder.</p><p class="calibre10">While the <code class="email">GOPATH</code> location can contain a list of colon-separated folders, such as <code class="email">PATH</code>Â and you can even have a different value for <code class="email">GOPATH</code> depending on which project you are working in it is strongly recommended that you use a single <code class="email">GOPATH</code> location for everything, and this is what we will assume you will do for the projects in this book.</p><p class="calibre10">Create a new folder called <code class="email">go</code>, this time in your <code class="email">Users</code> folder somewhere perhaps in a <code class="email">Work</code> subfolder. This will be our <code class="email">GOPATH</code> target and is where all the third-party code and binaries will end up as well as where we will write our Go programs and packages. Using the same technique you used when setting the <code class="email">PATH</code> environment variable in the previous section, set the <code class="email">GOPATH</code> variable to the new <code class="email">go</code> folder. Let's open a terminal and use one of the newly installed commands to get a third-party package for us to use:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">go get github.com/matryer/silk</strong></span>
</pre><p class="calibre10">Getting the <code class="email">silk</code> library will actually cause this folder structure to be created: <code class="email">$GOPATH/src/github.com/matryer/silk</code>. You can see that the path segments are important in how Go organizes things, which helps namespace projects and keeps them unique. For example, if you created your own package called <code class="email">silk</code>, you wouldn't keep it in the GitHub repository of <code class="email">matryer</code>, so the path would be different.</p><p class="calibre10">When we create projects in this book, you should consider a sensible <code class="email">GOPATH</code> root for them. For example, I used <code class="email">github.com/matryer/goblueprints</code>, and if you were to go get that, you would actually get a complete copy of all the source code for this book in your <code class="email">GOPATH</code> folder!</p></div></div></body></html>
