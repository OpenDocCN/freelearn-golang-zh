- en: Sublime Text 3 is an excellent editor to write Go code that runs on OS X, Linux,
    and Windows and has an extremely powerful expansion model, which makes it easy
    to customize and extend. You can download Sublime Text from [http://www.sublimetext.com/](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
    and trial-use it for free before deciding whether you want to buy it or not.

    there is already a Sublime expansion package for Go, which actually gives us a
    wealth of features and power that a lot of Go programmers actually miss out on.
    We are going to install this `GoSublime` package and then build upon it to add
    our desired on-save functionality.

- en: Before we can install `GoSublime`, we need to install Package Control into Sublime
    Text. Head over to [https://sublime.wbond.net/](https://sublime.wbond.net/) and
    click on the **Installation** link for instructions on how to install Package
    Control. At the time of writing this, it's simply a case of copying the single,
    albeit long, line command and pasting it into the Sublime console, which can be
    opened by navigating to **View** | **Show Console** from the menu.

    Install Package` and press *return* when you have selected the option. After a
    short delay (where Package Control is updating its listings), a box will appear,
    allowing you to search for and install GoSublime just by typing it in, selecting
    it, and pressing *return*. If all is well, GoSublime will be installed and writing
    Go code will just become an order of magnitude easier.'

    the details of the package by pressing *command + ., command + 2* (the command
    key and period at the same time, followed by the command key and number 2).

    the `on_save` property without corrupting the file. For example, if you have properties
    before and after, ensure the appropriate commas are in place.

    install test dependencies, run tests, and vet the code whenever we save the file.
    Save the settings file (don't close it just yet), and let's see this in action.

    to open for now, let''s open our `tooling` folder. The simple user interface of
    Sublime Text makes it clear that we only have one file in our project right now:
    `main.go`. Click on the file and add some extra linefeeds, and add and remove
    some indenting. Then, navigate to **File** | **Save** from the menu, or press
    *command + S*. Note that the code is immediately cleaned up, and provided that
    you haven''t removed the oddly placed return statement from `main.go`, you will
    notice that the console has appeared and is reporting the issue thanks to go vet:'

    You can see how helpful this feature is going to be as you continue to write Go
    code.

    you are told about the problem, but it wasn''t automatically fixed. This is because
    we have another tweak to make. In the same settings file as the one you added
    the `on_save` property to, add the following property:'

    this file again, and head back to `main.go`. Add `net/http` to the imports again,
    remove `fmt` import, and save the file. Note that the unused package was removed,
    and `fmt` was put back again.
