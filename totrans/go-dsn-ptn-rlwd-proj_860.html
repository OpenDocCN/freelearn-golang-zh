We learned about the <code class="email">GOPATH</code> environment variable and discovered a common practice of keeping one value for all projects. This approach dramatically simplifies working on Go projects, where you are likely to continue to encounter tricky failures otherwise.</p><p class="calibre10">We discovered how the Go toolset can really help us produce high-quality, community-standards-compliant code that any other programmer could pick up and work on with little to no additional learning. And more importantly, we looked at how automating the use of these tools means we can truly get down to the business of writing applications and solving problems, which is all developers really want to do.</p><p class="calibre10">We looked at a couple of options for code editors or IDEs and saw how easy it was to add plugins or extensions that help writing Go code easier.</p></div></body></html>
