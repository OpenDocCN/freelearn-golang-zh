			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Each great journey begins with a humble step. Our upcoming adventure with Go programming is no exception. Before we can do awesome things using Go, we need to be prepared with a productive environment. For this book to best serve you, you should install Git, Docker, and Go version 1.21 or higher. It is recommended that you have 4GB of RAM, and virtualization enabled in BIOS (usually enabled by default). The book is best suited for macOS or Linux, and will require minor tweaks for using Windows equivalent commands if needed. It is recommended to use a 1.6 GHz or faster <span class="No-Break">desktop processor.</span></p>
			<p>A helping hand on <span class="No-Break">additional setup:</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Install the Go Compiler</h2>
			<p>To turn your Go source code into something you can run, you’ll need the Go compiler. For Windows and macOS, we recommend using the installer. Alternatively, to get more control you can download precompiled binaries. You can find both at <a href="https://packt.live/2PRUGjp">https://packt.live/2PRUGjp</a>. The install instructions for both methods on Windows, macOS, and Linux are at <a href="https://packt.live/375DQDA">https://packt.live/375DQDA</a>. The Go compiler is free to download <span class="No-Break">and use.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Install Git</h2>
			<p>Go uses the version control tool Git to install extra tools and code. You can find the instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux at <a href="https://packt.live/35ByRug">https://packt.live/35ByRug</a>. Git is free to install <span class="No-Break">and use.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Install Visual Studio Code (Editor/IDE)</h2>
			<p>You need something to write your Go source code. This tool is called an editor or an <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>). If you already have an editor you like, you can use it with this course if you’d <span class="No-Break">like to.</span></p>
			<p>If you don’t already have an editor, we recommend you use the free editor Visual Studio Code. You can download the installer <span class="No-Break">from </span><a href="https://packt.live/35KD2Ek"><span class="No-Break">https://packt.live/35KD2Ek</span></a><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Once it’s installed, open Visual <span class="No-Break">Studio Code.</span></li>
				<li>From the top menu bar, <span class="No-Break">select </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">View</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>From the list of options, <span class="No-Break">select </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Extensions</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>A panel should appear on the left side. At the top is a search input box. <span class="No-Break">Type </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Go</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>The first option should be an extension called <strong class="bold">Go </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">by Microsoft</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button on <span class="No-Break">that option.</span></li>
				<li>Wait for a message that says it’s <span class="No-Break">successfully installed.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you have Git installed, follow <span class="No-Break">these steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Press <em class="italic">Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P</em> all at the same time. A text input should appear at the top of <span class="No-Break">the window.</span></li>
				<li>Type <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">go tools</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Select the option labelled something like <strong class="bold">Go: </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Install/Update Tools</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>You’ll see a list of options <span class="No-Break">and checkboxes.</span></li>
				<li>The very first checkbox next to the search input checks all the checkboxes. Select this checkbox, then select the <strong class="bold">Go</strong> button to the right <span class="No-Break">of it.</span></li>
				<li>A panel from the bottom should appear with some activity in it. Once this stops (and it may take a few minutes), you’re <span class="No-Break">all done.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once done, select <strong class="bold">View</strong> from the top menu bar, then <span class="No-Break">select </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Explorer</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Install Docker</h2>
			<p>Docker allows us to run things such as database servers without having to install them and containerize our applications. Docker is free to install <span class="No-Break">and use.</span></p>
			<p>For macOS users, follow the instructions <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://packt.live/34VJLJD"><span class="No-Break">https://packt.live/34VJLJD</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p>You are safe to uninstall Docker, if you wish, once the book <span class="No-Break">is complete.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-13"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Install PostgreSQL</h2>
			<p>PostgreSQL is used within the chapter covering database interactions. To install the PostgreSQL driver, follow the instructions <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.postgresql.org/download/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
