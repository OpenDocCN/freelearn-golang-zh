    programming is no exception. Before we can do awesome things using Go, we need
    to be prepared with a productive environment. For this book to best serve you,
    you should install Git, Docker, and Go version 1.21 or higher. It is recommended
    that you have 4GB of RAM, and virtualization enabled in BIOS (usually enabled
    by default). The book is best suited for macOS or Linux, and will require minor
    tweaks for using Windows equivalent commands if needed. It is recommended to use
    a 1.6 GHz or faster desktop processor.
