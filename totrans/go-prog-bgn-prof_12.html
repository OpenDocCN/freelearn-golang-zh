			<p class="callout-heading"><a id="_idTextAnchor1534"/>Overview</p>
			<p class="callout">This chapter demonstrates how Go handles variables representing time data, which is a very important aspect of <span class="No-Break">the language.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create your own time format, compare and manage time, calculate the duration of time series, and format time according to <span class="No-Break">user requirements.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-329"><a id="_idTextAnchor1535"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>For this chapter, you'll require Go version 1.21 or higher. The code for this chapter can be found <span class="No-Break">at: </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Go-Programming-From-Beginner-to-Professional-Second-Edition-/blob/main/Chapter12"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Go-Programming-From-Beginner-to-Professional-Second-Edition-/blob/main/Chapter12</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-330"><a id="_idTextAnchor1536"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1537"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The previous chapter introduced you to basic debugging in Go. The more you develop code in Go, the better you get; however, developing and deploying code may come with corner cases that need to be debugged. The previous chapter showed you how to use the <strong class="source-inline">fmt</strong> package, how to log in to files, and how to use printing verbs for <span class="No-Break">string formatting.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter is dedicated to teaching you all you need to know about handling variables that represent time data. You will learn <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>how to do it the “Go way.” First, we will start out with basic time creation, timestamps, and more; then, we will learn how to compare and manipulate time, calculate the duration between two dates, and create timestamps. Finally, we will learn how to format time according to our needs. So, let’s not waste any more time and jump <span class="No-Break">right in.</span><a id="_idTextAnchor1538"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1539"/></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-331"><a id="_idTextAnchor1540"/>Making time</h1>
			<p>Making time means declaring a variable that holds the time formatted in a specific way. Formatting time will be covered at the end of this <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>chapter; so, for now, we will use the default formatting that is provided by Go. In this topic, we will be executing everything in the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function of our script, so the skeleton should look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
package main
import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)
func main(){
  // this is where the code goes.
}</pre>			<p>Let’s look at our skeleton first and learn how to create and manipulate <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> variables. Our skeleton has the standard <strong class="source-inline">package main</strong> definition that is necessary. We use the <strong class="source-inline">fmt</strong> package to print the output to the console. Since we’ll be using the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package, we’ll need to import that <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>Whenever we issue <strong class="source-inline">go run &lt;script&gt;.go</strong>, the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function gets called and executes whatever is declared <span class="No-Break">in it.</span></p>
			<p>One of the most common jobs for the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package is to measure the duration of the execution of the script. We can do this by capturing the current time in a variable, at the beginning, and at the end so that we can calculate the difference and know how long the specific action took to complete. The time difference will be shown later in the book chapter. The very first example is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
  start := time.Now()
  fmt.Println("The script has started at: ", start)
  fmt.Println("Saving the world...")
  time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
  end := time.Now()
  fmt.Println("The script has completed at: ", end)</pre>			<p>The output from our script should look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
The script has started at: 2023-09-27 08:19:33.8358274 +0200 CEST m=+0.001998701
Saving the world...
The script has completed at: 2023-09-27 08:19:35.8400169 +0200 CEST m=+2.006161301</pre>			<p>As you can see, this does not look very fancy; however, by the end of this chapter, you will have learned how to make it <span class="No-Break">more readable.</span></p>
			<p>Consider the following scenario: your employer gives you a task to develop a small Go application that tests a web application based on the day of the week. Your employer has the main release of a new web <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>app every Monday at 12:00 A.M. CEST. With a downtime window from 12:00 A.M. CEST to 2:00 P.M. CEST, and the deployment being about 30 minutes, you have 1.5 hours to test the app. This is where Go’s <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package comes to your rescue. The script performs a <strong class="source-inline">hit-n-run</strong> test on the other days of the week, but on release day, you are required to perform a <strong class="source-inline">full-blown</strong> functionality test. The first version of the script took the argument to see which test to perform, but the second script version made the decision based on the day and <span class="No-Break">the hour:</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.1: Testing strategies</p>
			<p>Consider the <span class="No-Break">following code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
  day := time.Now().Weekday()
  hour := time.Now().Hour()
  fmt.Println("Day: ", day, "Hour: ", hour)
  if day.String() == "Monday"{
    if hour &gt;= 1{
      fmt.Println("Performing full blown test!")
    } else {
      fmt.Println("Performing hit-n-run test!")
    }
  } else { fmt.Println("Performing hit-n-run test!")}</pre>			<p>The current day of the week is captured in the variable called <strong class="source-inline">day</strong>. The hour of execution is also captured in the variable called <strong class="source-inline">hour</strong>. When this script is executed, there are two types <span class="No-Break">of output.</span></p>
			<p>The first one is a<a id="_idIndexMarker796"/> simple <strong class="source-inline">hit-n-run</strong> output, <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Day: Thursday Hour: 14
Performing hit-n-run test!</pre>			<p>The second one is the <strong class="source-inline">full blown</strong> output, <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Day: Thursday Hour: 14
Performing full blown test!</pre>			<p>In this example, we have seen how the day of execution modifies the behavior of <span class="No-Break">the application.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The actual test was left out intentionally as this is not part of the chapter’s topic. However, the output clearly shows which part was responsible for the control of <span class="No-Break">the test.</span></p>
			<p>Another example would be to create the log filenames for scripts in Go. The basic idea is to collect a log per day and have a timestamp concatenated with the name of the log file. The skeleton looks <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Application_Action_Year_Month_Day</pre>			<p>In Go, there is an elegant and simple way to do it within your <span class="No-Break">main function:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
package main 
import ( 
  "fmt" 
  "strconv" 
  "time" 
) 
func main() { 
  appName := "HTTPCHECKER" 
  action := "BASIC" 
  date := time.Now() 
  logFileName := appName + "_" + action + "_" + strconv.Itoa(date.Year()) + "_" + date.Month().String() + "_" + strconv.Itoa(date.Day()) + ".log" 
  fmt.Println("The name of the logfile is ", logFileName) 
} </pre>			<p>The output appears <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
The name of the logfile is: HTTPCHECKER_BASIC_2024_March_16.log</pre>			<p>However, there is a catch. If you want to concatenate strings with <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> types, which are not implicitly convertible, use<a id="_idIndexMarker797"/> the <strong class="source-inline">strconv</strong> package, which needs to be imported on top of <span class="No-Break">your script:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import "strconv"</pre>			<p>In turn, this allows you to call the <strong class="source-inline">strconv.Itoa()</strong> function, which converts your <strong class="source-inline">Year</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Day</strong> values and, finally, lets you concatenate them into a <span class="No-Break">single string.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have learned how to make <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> variables, let’s learn to <span class="No-Break">compare th<a id="_idTextAnchor1541"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1542"/>em.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-332"><a id="_idTextAnchor1543"/>Exercise 12.01 – Creating a function to return a timestamp</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will create a<a id="_idIndexMarker798"/> function called <strong class="source-inline">whatstheclock</strong>. The goal of this function is to demonstrate how you can create a function that wraps a nice, formatted <strong class="source-inline">time.Now()</strong> function and returns the date in an <strong class="source-inline">ANSIC</strong> format. The <strong class="source-inline">ANSIC</strong> format will be <a id="_idIndexMarker799"/>explained in further detail in the <em class="italic">Formatting </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">time</em></span><span class="No-Break"> section:</span></p>

			<p>In this exercise, we demonstrated how you can create a small function that returns the current time in an <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">ANSIC</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> format.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Any type of operating system that you work with will provide two types of clocks to measure the time; one is called the “monotonic clock,” and the other is called the “wall clock.” The wall clock is what you see on a Windows machine in the taskbar; it’s subject to change and is usually synchronized with a public<a id="_idIndexMarker802"/> or corporate <strong class="bold">Network Time Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">NTP</strong>) server based on your current location. NTP is used to tell clients the time based on an atomic clock or from a <span class="No-Break">satellite re<a id="_idTextAnchor1544"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1545"/>ference.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-333"><a id="_idTextAnchor1546"/>Comparing time</h1>
			<p>Most of the time, when working with Go on smaller scripts, it is very important for your statistics to know when a<a id="_idIndexMarker803"/> script should run, or between what hours and minutes a script should be completed. By statistics, we mean knowing how much time the app saves by executing a specific operation compared to what time cost it would have if we had to perform these manually. This allows us to measure the improvement of the script over time when we develop the functionality further. In this topic, we will look at some live examples demonstrating how you can solve <span class="No-Break">this problem.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at the logic for the first script, which was intended not to run before or after a specified time. This time can arrive either via another automation or when a trigger file is manually placed there; every day, the script needs to run at different times –specifically, after the specified time as soon <span class="No-Break">as possible.</span></p>
			<p>The time was in the following <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">2023-09-27T22:08:41+00:00</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> format:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
  now := time.Now()
  onlAafter, err := time.Parse(time.RFC3339,"2020-11-01T22:08:41+00:00")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(now, onlyAfter)
  fmt.Println(now.After(onlyAfter))
  if now.After(onlyAfter){
    fmt.Println("Executing actions!")
  } else {
    fmt.Println("Now is not the time yet!!")
  }</pre>			<p>The output of the script when we are not yet at the deadline is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Now is not the time yet!!</pre>			<p>When we meet the criteria, the output looks <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Executing actions!</pre>			<p>Let’s examine what is happening here. We create a <strong class="source-inline">now</strong> variable, which is crucial for the execution. We have the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> string parsed based on <strong class="source-inline">RFC3339</strong>. <strong class="source-inline">RFC3339</strong> specifies the format that should be used for the <strong class="source-inline">date</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> strings. This function returns two values: one value is the output if the conversion succeeds, and the other is the error if there is one. We capture the <a id="_idIndexMarker804"/>output in the onlyAfter variable, along with the error, err. We could use a standard variable such as onlyAfterError, but unless we use that variable later in time, the compiler will throw an error that the variable was declared but never used. This is circumvented using the _ variable. Based on this logic, we could implement the <strong class="source-inline">onlyBefore</strong> argument or variable very simply. The <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package has two particularly useful functions: one is called <strong class="source-inline">After()</strong>, and the other is called <strong class="source-inline">Before()</strong>. They allow us to simply compare two <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">time</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> variables.</span></p>
			<p>There is a third function in the package called <strong class="source-inline">Equal()</strong>. This function allows you to compare two <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> variables and returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> depending on whether they <span class="No-Break">are equal.</span></p>
			<p>Let us look at an example of the <strong class="source-inline">Equal()</strong> function <span class="No-Break">in action:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
  now := time.Now()
  nowToo := now
  time.Sleep(2*time.Second)
  later := time.Now()
  if now.Equal(nowTtoo){
    fmt.Println("The two time variables are equal!")
  } else {
    fmt.Println("The two time variables are different!")
  }
  if now.Equal(later) {
    fmt.Println("The two time variables are equal!")
  }else{
    fmt.Println("The two time variables are different!")
  }</pre>			<p>The output looks <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
The two time variables are equal!
The two time variables are different!</pre>			<p>Let’s see what happens here. We have three <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> variables, which are called <strong class="source-inline">now</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">now_too</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">later</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> module’s <strong class="source-inline">Sleep()</strong> function is used to simulate the latency of 2 seconds. This function takes an integer argument and waits for the given time to pass and then continues the<a id="_idIndexMarker805"/> execution. The result of this is that the <strong class="source-inline">later</strong> variable holds different time values and allows us to demonstrate the <strong class="source-inline">Equal()</strong> function’s purpose, which you can see in <span class="No-Break">the output.</span></p>
			<p>Now, the time has come to check what facilities are provided to calculate the duration or difference between the two <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">time<a id="_idTextAnchor1547"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1548"/></strong></span><span class="No-Break"> variables.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-334"><a id="_idTextAnchor1549"/>Duration calculation</h1>
			<p>The ability to calculate the duration <a id="_idIndexMarker806"/>of an execution comes in handy during many aspects of programming. In our everyday lives, we can monitor discrepancies and performance bottlenecks that our infrastructure might face. For example, if you have a script that takes only 5 seconds to complete on average and the monitoring execution time shows you a huge bump during certain hours of a day or certain days, it might be wise to investigate. The other aspect is related to web applications. Measuring the duration of request-response in your scripts can give you an insight into how well invested you are in your apps to serve high loads, and it even allows you to expand your capacity on certain days or weeks of the year. For example, if you have an online shop dealing with products, it might be wise to size your capacity according to patterns such as Black Friday <span class="No-Break">or Christmas.</span></p>
			<p>You may do well with a lower capacity during most of the year, but those holidays can result in revenue loss if the infrastructure is not sufficiently well sized. There is very little coding required to add such functionality<a id="_idIndexMarker807"/> to your scripts. Let’s now look at how to <span class="No-Break">do it:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
  start := time.Now()
  fmt.Println("The script started at: ", start)
  sum := 0
  for i := 1; i &lt; 10000000000; i++ {
    sum += i
  }
  end := time.Now()
  duration := end.Sub(start)
  fmt.Println("The script completed at: ", end)
  fmt.Println("The task took", duration.Hours(), "hour(s) to complete!")
  fmt.Println("The task took", duration.Minutes(), "minutes(s) to complete!")
  fmt.Println("The task took", duration.Seconds(), "seconds(s) to complete!")
  fmt.Println("The task took", duration.Nanoseconds(), "nanosecond(s) to complete!")</pre>			<p>If you execute this script, the result will be something like this, depending on the <span class="No-Break">PC’s <a id="_idTextAnchor1550"/>performance:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer143" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18621_12_02.jpg" alt="Figure 12.2: Measuring the execution time" width="1319" height="204"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.2: Measuring the execution time</p>
			<p>All that needs to be done is to capture the time when the script starts and ends. Then, we can calculate the duration by subtracting the start time and the end time. After that, we can utilize the <strong class="source-inline">Duration</strong> variable’s functions to get the <strong class="source-inline">Hours()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Minutes()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Seconds()</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Nanoseconds()</strong> values of the time it took to complete <span class="No-Break">the task.</span></p>
			<p>There are four resolutions you will be provided with – namely, <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Hours</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Minutes</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Seconds</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Nanoseconds</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you need, for example, days, weeks, or<a id="_idIndexMarker808"/> months, then you can calculate it from the <span class="No-Break">resolutions provided.</span></p>
			<p>Back in the day, we had a requirement to measure the duration of transactions, and we had a <strong class="bold">service-level agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLA</strong>) that needed to<a id="_idIndexMarker809"/> be met. This meant that there were applications that needed to process a request in, let’s say, 1,000 ms or 5 s depending on the criticality of the product. The next script will show you how this was implemented. There are six different resolutions that you have the option to <span class="No-Break">choose from:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Hour</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Minute</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Second</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Millisecond</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Microsecond</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Nanosecond</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s consider the <span class="No-Break">following example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
  deadlineSeconds := time.Duration((600 * 10) * time.Millisecond)
  start := time.Now()
  fmt.Println("Deadline for the transaction is", deadlineSeconds)
  fmt.Println("The transaction has started at:", start)
  sum := 0
  for i := 1; i &lt; 25000000000; i++ {
    sum += i
  }
  end := time.Now()
  duration := end.Sub(start)
  transactionTime := time.Duration(duration.Nanoseconds()) * time.Nanosecond
  fmt.Println("The transaction has completed at:", end, duration)
  if transactionTime &lt;= deadlineSeconds{
    fmt.Println("Performance is OK transaction completed in", transactionTime)
  } else{
    fmt.Println("Performance problem, transaction completed in", transactionTime,"second(s)!")
  }</pre>			<p>When we don’t meet the deadline, the output i<a id="_idTextAnchor1551"/>s <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>

				<div id="_idContainer144" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.4: Transaction deadline met</p>
			<p>Let’s dissect our example. First, we define a deadline for the transaction with the <strong class="source-inline">time.Duration()</strong> variable. In my experience, the <strong class="source-inline">Millisecond</strong> resolution is optimal; however, it does take some time to get used to calculating it. Feel free to use whichever resolution you prefer. We mark the beginning with the <strong class="source-inline">start</strong> variable, do some calculations, and mark the completion with the <strong class="source-inline">end</strong> variable. The magic happens after this. We would like to <a id="_idIndexMarker811"/>calculate the difference between the deadline and the transaction duration, but we cannot do it directly. We need to convert the <strong class="source-inline">duration</strong> value to <strong class="source-inline">transaction</strong> time. This was done the same way when we created our deadline. We simply use the <strong class="source-inline">Nanosecond</strong> resolution, which is the lowest resolution we should go to. However, in this case, you can use the resolution you would like. After conversion, we can easily compare and decide whether the transaction is fine <span class="No-Break">or not.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s see how we can <span class="No-Break">ma<a id="_idTextAnchor1553"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1554"/>nipulate time.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-335"><a id="_idTextAnchor1555"/>Managing time</h1>
			<p>The Go programming language’s <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package provides two functions that allow you to manipulate time. One of them<a id="_idIndexMarker812"/> is called <strong class="source-inline">Sub()</strong>, and the other one is called <strong class="source-inline">Add()</strong>. There have not been many cases, in my experience, where this has been used. Mostly, when calculating the elapsed time of a script’s execution, the <strong class="source-inline">Sub()</strong> function is used to tell <span class="No-Break">the difference.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s see what the addition <span class="No-Break">looks like:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
  timeToManipulate := time.Now()
  toBeAdded := time.Duration(10 * time.Second)
  fmt.Println("The original time:", timeToManipulate)

The <strong class="source-inline">toBeAdded</strong> variable represents a duration of 10 seconds, which we would like to add. The <strong class="source-inline">Add()</strong> function of the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package expects a variable of the <strong class="source-inline">time.Duration()</strong> type. Then, we simply call the <strong class="source-inline">Add()</strong> function of our date, and the result is visible on the console. The functionality of the <strong class="source-inline">Sub()</strong> function is rather cumbersome, and<a id="_idIndexMarker813"/> it is not really intended to remove a specific duration from the time we have. It can be done, but you need many more lines of code to achieve this. What you can do is craft your duration with a negative value. Swap out the second line <span class="No-Break">for this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
toBeAdded := time.Duration(-10 * time.Minute)</pre>			<p>It will work just fine and output <span class="No-Break">you this:</span></p>

			<p>Now, let’s turn our eyes toward the <a id="_idTextAnchor1559"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1560"/>formatting <span class="No-Break">of time.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-337"><a id="_idTextAnchor1561"/>Formatting time</h1>
			<p>So far in this chapter, you may have <a id="_idIndexMarker817"/>noticed that the dates are pretty ugly. I mean, take a look at the <span class="No-Break">following lines:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
The transaction has started at: 2023-09-27 13:50:58.2715452 +0200 CEST m=+0.002992801</pre>			<p>These were intentionally left there to force you to think about whether this is all that Go can do. Is there a way to format these lines to make them more convenient and easier to read? If so, what are those <span class="No-Break">extra lines?</span></p>
			<p>Here, we will answer those questions. When we talk about time formatting, there are two main concepts we are referring to. The first option is for instances when we would like our <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> variable to output a desirable-looking string when we use it in print, and the second option is for when we would like to take a string and parse it to a specific format. Both have their own use cases; we are going to look at them in more detail as I teach you how to <span class="No-Break">use both.</span></p>
			<p>First, we are going to learn about the <strong class="source-inline">Parse()</strong> function. This function has essentially two arguments. The first one is the format string to parse against, and the second one is the string that needs to be parsed. The end of this parse will result in a <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> variable that can utilize built-in Go functions. Go <a id="_idIndexMarker818"/>uses a POSIX-based date format, where <strong class="bold">POSIX</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Portable Operating System Interface</strong>, thus allowing Go applications to run on any Unix flavor. <strong class="source-inline">Parse()</strong> is very useful when you have an application that is working with time values from different time zones and you would like to convert them, for example, to the same time zone for better understanding and <span class="No-Break">easier comparison:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006
0 1 2 3 4 5 6</pre>			<p>This date format is equal to “<strong class="source-inline">123456</strong>” in POSIX, which can be decoded from the preceding example. There are constants provided in<a id="_idIndexMarker819"/> the language to help you deal with parsing different <span class="No-Break">time strings.</span></p>
			<p>There are three main time formats against which we <span class="No-Break">can parse:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">RFC3339</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">UnixDate</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">ANSIC</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s look at how <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Parse()</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> works:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
  t1, err := time.Parse(time.RFC3339, "2019-09-27T22:18:11+00:00")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
  t2, err := time.Parse(time.UnixDate, "2019-09-27T22:18:11+00:00")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
  t3, err := time.Parse(time.ANSIC, "2019-09-27T22:18:11+00:00")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
  fmt.Println("RFC3339:", t1)
  fmt.Println("UnixDate", t2)
  fmt.Println("ANSIC", t3)</pre>			<p>The output is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
parsing time "2019-09-27T22:18:11+00:00" as "Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 MST 2006": cannot parse "2019-09-27T22:18:11+00:00" as "Mon"
parsing time "2019-09-27T22:18:11+00:00" as "Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 2006": cannot parse "2019-09-27T22:18:11+00:00" as "Mon"
RFC3339: 2019-09-27 22:18:11 +0000 +0000
UnixDate 0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
ANSIC 0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC</pre>			<p>What happens behind the scenes is as follows. We have the <strong class="source-inline">t1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">t2</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">t3</strong> variables that hold the time, which is parsed against the specified format. The <strong class="source-inline">err</strong> variables hold the error results if there are any during the conversion. The output from the <strong class="source-inline">t1</strong> variable is the only one that makes sense; <strong class="source-inline">UnixDate</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">ANSIC</strong> are wrong because the wrong string is parsed against the format. <strong class="source-inline">UnixDate</strong> expects something that they call <strong class="source-inline">epoch</strong>. The epoch is a very<a id="_idIndexMarker820"/> unique date; on Unix systems, it marks the beginning of time, which starts at January 1, 1970. It expects a huge integer, which is the number of seconds elapsed since this date. The format expects something like this as the input: <strong class="source-inline">Mon Sep _27 18:24:05 2019</strong>. Providing such time allows the <strong class="source-inline">Parse()</strong> function to provide the <span class="No-Break">correct output.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have clarified the <strong class="source-inline">Parse()</strong> function, it’s time to look at the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Format()</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> function.</span></p>
			<p>Go allows you to craft your own <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> variables. Let’s learn how we can do that and, afterward, we will <span class="No-Break">format them:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
date := time.Date(2019, 9, 27, 18, 50, 48, 324359102, time.UTC)
fmt.Println(date)</pre>			<p>The preceding code demonstrates how you can craft the time for yourself; however, we are going to look at what all those numbers are. The skeleton syntax for that is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
func Date(year int, month Month, day, hour, min, sec, nsec int, loc *Location) Time</pre>			<p>Essentially, we need to specify the year, month, day, hour, and so on. We would like to reformat our output based on the input variables; this should appear <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
2019-09-27 18:50:48.324359102 +0000 UTC</pre>			<p>Time zones were not important until people started working in big enterprise environments. When you have a global fleet of interconnected devices, it is important to be able to differentiate between<a id="_idIndexMarker821"/> time zones. If you want to have an <strong class="source-inline">AddDate()</strong> function, which can be used to add <strong class="source-inline">Year</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Month</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Day</strong> to your current time, then this must enable you to dynamically add to your dates. Let’s look at an example. Given our previous date, let’s add 1 year, 2 months, and <span class="No-Break">3 days:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
date := time.Date(2019, 9, 27, 18, 50, 48, 324359102, time.UTC)
next Date := date.AddDate(1, 2, 3)
fmt.Println(next Date)</pre>			<p>You will get the following output upon execution of <span class="No-Break">this program:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
2020-11-30 18:50:48.324359102 +0000 UTC</pre>			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">AddDate()</strong> function takes three arguments: the first is <strong class="source-inline">years</strong>, the second is <strong class="source-inline">months</strong>, and the third is <strong class="source-inline">days</strong>. This gives you the opportunity to fine-tune the scripts you have. To properly understand how formatting works, you need to know what is under <span class="No-Break">the hood.</span></p>
			<p>One last important aspect of time formatting is to understand how you can utilize the <strong class="source-inline">LoadLocation()</strong> function of the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package to convert your local time to the local time of another time zone. Our reference time zone will be the <strong class="source-inline">Los Angeles</strong> time zone. The <strong class="source-inline">Format()</strong> function is used to tell Go how we would like to see our output formatted. The <strong class="source-inline">In()</strong> function is a reference to a specific time zone we want our formatting to be <span class="No-Break">present in.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s find out what the time is in <span class="No-Break">Los Angeles:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
  current := time.Now()
  losAngeles, err := time.LoadLocation("America/Los_Angeles")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
  fmt.Println("The local current time is:", current.Format(time.ANSIC))
  fmt.Println("The time in Los Angeles is:", current.In(losAngeles).Format(time.ANSIC))</pre>			<p>Depending on your day of execution, you should see the <span class="No-Break">following output:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
The local current time is: Fri Oct 18 08:14:48 2019
The time in Los Angeles is: Thu Oct 17 23:14:48 2019</pre>			<p>The key here is that we get our local time in<a id="_idIndexMarker822"/> a variable, and then we use the <strong class="source-inline">In()</strong> function of the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package to, say, convert that value to a specific time zone’s value.<a id="_idTextAnchor1562"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1563"/> It’s simple, <span class="No-Break">yet useful.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-338"><a id="_idTextAnchor1564"/>Exercise 12.03 – What is the time in your zone?</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will create a function that tells the difference between the current time zone and the <a id="_idIndexMarker823"/>specified time zone. The function will utilize the <strong class="source-inline">LoadLocation()</strong> function to specify the location based on which a variable will be set to a specific time. The <strong class="source-inline">In()</strong> location will be used to convert a specific time value to a given time zone value. The output format should be in the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">ANSIC</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> standard.</span></p>

			<p>This activity requires you to<a id="_idIndexMarker831"/> utilize what you learned in the <em class="italic">Formatting time</em> section. You need to load an east coast city and a west coast city. Then, print out the current time for <span class="No-Break">each city.</span></p>
			<p>The key here is the <strong class="source-inline">LoadLocation()</strong> function, and you need to use the <strong class="source-inline">ANSIC</strong> format for the output. Remember that the <strong class="source-inline">LoadLocation()</strong> function returns <span class="No-Break">two values!</span></p>
			<p>You must perform the following steps to get the <span class="No-Break">desired output:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Capture the current time in <span class="No-Break">a variable.</span></li>
				<li>Create reference time zone variables for <strong class="source-inline">NyTime</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">LaTime</strong> using the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">time.LoadLocation()</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> function.</span></li>
				<li>Print out, in <strong class="source-inline">ANSIC</strong> format, the current time in the respective <span class="No-Break">time zones.</span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-344"><a id="_idTextAnchor1576"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter introduced you to the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package of Go, which allows you to reuse code that has been invented by other programmers and incorporated into the language. The goal was to teach you how to create, manipulate, and format <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> variables, and, in general, make you familiar with what you can do with the help of the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package. If you would like to further improve or dig deeper into what the package has to offer, you should check out the following <span class="No-Break">link: </span><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/"><span class="No-Break">https://golang.org/pkg/time/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Timestamps and time manipulation are essential skills for every developer. Whether you have a big or small script put into production, the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> module helps you to measure the elapsed time of actions and provide you with the logging of actions that happen during the execution. The most important thing about it, if used correctly, is that it helps you to easily trace back production problems to <span class="No-Break">their roots.</span></p>
