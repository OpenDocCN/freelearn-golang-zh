    An HTTP client is something that is used to get data from or send data to a web
    server. Probably the most well-known example of an HTTP client is a web browser
    (such as Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge). When you enter a web address into
    a web browser, it will have an HTTP client built in that sends a request to the
    server for data. The server will gather the data and send it back to the HTTP
    client, which will then display the web page in the browser. Similarly, when you
    fill out a form in a web browser, for example, when you log in to a website, the
    browser will use its HTTP client to send that form data to the server and then
    take appropriate action, depending on the response.

    a web server and send data to a server. You will examine the different ways you
    can use the HTTP client to interact with a web server and the various use cases
    for those interactions. The web browser example will be useful in explaining the
    different interactions. As part of this chapter, you will create your own Go programs
    that make use of the Go HTTP Client to send and receive data from a web server.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Go HTTP Client is part of the Go standard library, specifically the `net/http`
    package. There are two main ways to use it. The first is to use the default HTTP
    client that is included in the `net/http` package. It’s simple to use and allows
    you to get up and running quickly. The second way is to create your own HTTP client
    based on the default HTTP client. This allows you to customize the requests and
    various other things. It takes longer to configure, but it gives you much more
    freedom and control over the requests you send.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When using an HTTP client, you can send different types of requests. While
    there are many types of requests, we will discuss the two main ones: the GET request
    and the POST request. For instance, if you wanted to retrieve data from a server,
    you would send a GET request. When you enter a web address in your web browser,
    it will send a GET request to the server at that address and then display the
    data it returns. If you wanted to send data to the server, you would send a POST
    request. If you wanted to log into a website, you would POST your login details
    to the server.'

    They will teach you how to request data from a server in various formats using
    GET requests. They will also teach you how to POST form data to a web server,
    similar to how a web browser would send a POST request when you log in to a website.
    These exercises will also show you how to upload a file to a web server and how
    to use a customized HTTP client to have more control over the requests you send.

    We are using this encoding to include files as part of the form data, as this
    is the standard way to handle file uploads in HTML forms.

    This approach works well with small files but can lead to memory overflow in the
    case of big files. Therefore, you may have to adapt the code if using large files
    to use alternative methods, such as `os.Pipe()`. In this example, with a small
    file, you had the file read in from the disk, formatted it into a POST request,
    and sent the data to the server. You saw the use of multipart form file uploading.
    We also saw the use of Go `http.DefaultClient`. `DefaultClient` works great; however,
    it should never be used in a production environment as it does not set a default
    timeout for HTTP requests. When making HTTP requests, it is crucial to set timeouts
    to ensure that your application does not hang indefinitely in the case of network
    issues or unresponsive servers.

    This information is stored within the request headers. A very common example of
    this is authorization headers. When you log into a server, it will respond with
    an authorization token. In all future requests sent to the server, you would include
    this token in the request’s headers so the server knows you are the one making
    the requests. You will learn how to add an authorization token to requests later.

- en: HTTP clients are used to interact with web servers. They are used to send different
    types of requests to a server (for example, GET or POST requests) and then react
    to the response returned by the server. A web browser is a type of HTTP client
    that will send a GET request to a web server and display the HTML data it returns.
    In Go, you created your own HTTP client and did the same thing, sending a GET
    request to [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com) and then logging the
    response returned by the server. You also learned about the components of a URL
    and that you can control what you request from a server by changing the URL.
