			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Go, with its straightforward syntax and pragmatic conventions, has solidified its position as the language of choice for developers tackling network programming, web services, data processing, and beyond. This book is designed to empower engineers by providing up-to-date, practical recipes for solving common <span class="No-Break">programming challenges.</span></p>
			<p>The journey begins with foundational principles, including effective approaches to organizing packages and structuring code for various project types. From there, the book delves into real-world engineering challenges, offering practical solutions in network programming, process management, database interactions, data pipelines, and testing. Each chapter presents working solutions and production-ready code snippets, tailored for both sequential and concurrent <span class="No-Break">programming environments.</span></p>
			<p>Leveraging Go’s most recent language features—such as generics and structured logging—the recipes in this book primarily rely on the Go standard library, ensuring minimal reliance on third-party packages and <span class="No-Break">maximizing compatibility.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you’ll have a wealth of proven, hands-on solutions to accelerate your Go development journey and tackle the complexities of modern software engineering <span class="No-Break">with confidence.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
