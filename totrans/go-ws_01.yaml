- en: Go (or golang as it's often called) is a programming language popular with developers
    because of how rewarding it is to use to develop software. It's also popular with
    companies because teams of all sizes can be productive with it. Go has also earned
    a reputation for consistently delivering software with exceptionally high performance.

- en: Go has an impressive pedigree since it was created by a team from Google with
    a long history of building great programming languages and operating systems.
    They created a language that has the feel of a dynamic language such as JavaScript
    or PHP but with the performance and efficiency of strongly typed languages such
    as C++ and Java. They wanted a language that was engaging for the programmer but
    practical in projects with hundreds of developers.

    memory safety and channel-based concurrency. We'll explore these features in this
    chapter. By doing so, you'll see that their unique implementation within Go is
    what makes Go truly special.

- en: Go is written in text files that are then compiled down to machine code and
    packaged into a single, standalone executable file. The executable is self-contained,
    with nothing needed to be installed first to allow it to run. Having a single
    file makes deploying and distributing Go software hassle-free. When compiling,
    you can pick one of several target operating systems, including but not limited
    to Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android. With Go, you write your code once and run
    it anywhere. Complied languages fell out of favor because programmers hated long
    waits for their code to compile. The Go team knew this and built a lightning-fast
    compiler that remains fast as projects grow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Go has a statically typed and type-safe memory model with a garbage collector.
    This combination protects developers from creating many of the most common bugs
    and security flaws found in software while still providing excellent performance
    and efficiency. Dynamically typed languages such as Ruby and Python have become
    popular in part because programmers felt they could be more productive if they
    didn't have to worry about types and memory. The downside of these languages is
    that they gave up performance and memory efficiency and can be more prone to type-mismatch
    bugs. Go has the same levels of productivity as dynamically typed languages while
    not giving up performance and efficiency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A massive shift in computer performance has taken place. Going fast now means
    you need to be able to do as much work parallel or concurrently as possible. This
    change is due to the design of modern CPUs, which emphasize more cores over high
    clock speed. None of the currently popular programming languages have been designed
    to take advantage of this fact, which makes writing parallel and concurrent code
    in them error-prone. Go is designed to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, and
    it removes all the frustration and bug-filled code. Go is designed to allow any
    developer to easily and safely write parallel and concurrent code that enables
    them to take advantage of modern multicore CPUs and cloud computing `–` unlocking
    high-performance processing and massive scalability without the drama.

    There are three types of lists in Go: slices, arrays, and maps. All three are
    collections of keys and values, where you use the key to get a value from the
    collection. Slice and array collections use a number as the key. The first key
    is always 0 in slices and arrays. Also, in slices and arrays, the numbers are
    contiguous, which means there is never a break in the sequence of numbers. With
    the `map` type, you get to choose the `key` type. You use this when you want to
    use some other data to look up the value in the map. For example, you could use

    need to do is ensure it's a good random number, so to do that, we must "seed"
    the random number generator. We seed it using the current time formatted to a
    Unix timestamp with nanoseconds. To get the time, we call the `Now` function in
    the `time` package. The `Now` function returns a struct type variable. Structs
    are a collection of properties and functions, a little like objects in other languages.
    In this case, we are calling the `UnixNano` function on that struct straight away.
    The `UnixNano` function returns a variable of the `int64` type, which is a 64-bit
    integer or, more simply, a number. This number is passed into `rand.Seed`. The
    `rand.Seed` function accepts an `int64` variable as its input. Note that the type
    of the variable from `time.UnixNano` and `rand.Seed` must be the same. Now, we've
    successfully seeded the random number generator.

    for this job. This function gives us a random number between 0 and 1, minus the
    number you pass in. This may sound a bit strange, but it works out perfectly for
    what we're trying to do. This is because our list is a slice where the keys start
    from 0 and increment by 1 for each value. This means the last index is 1 less

- en: In real-world code, it's not common to use the full var notation. There are
    a few cases where you need to define a package-level variable with an initial
    value and tightly control its type. In those cases, you need the full notation.
    It'll be obvious when this is needed as you'll have a type mismatch of some kind,
    so don't worry too much about this for now. The rest of the time, you'll remove
    an optional part or use the short variable declaration.

- en: You don't need to include both the type and the initial value when declaring
    a variable. You can use just one or the other; Go works out the rest. If you have
    a type in the declaration but no initial value, Go uses the zero value for the
    type you picked. We'll talk more about what a zero value is in a later chapter.
    On the other hand, if you have an initial value and no type, Go has a ruleset
    for how to infer the types that are needed from the literal value you use.

- en: In this exercise, we defined a variety of variable types without an initial
    value. Then, we printed them out using `fmt.Printf` to expose more detail about
    the values. Knowing what the zero values are and how Go controls them allows you
    to avoid bugs and write concise code.

    efficient software.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Value versus Pointer
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With values such as `int`, `bool`, and `string`, when you pass them to a function,
    Go makes a copy of the value, and it's the copy that's used in the function. This
    copying means that a change that's made to the value in the function doesn't affect
    the value that you used when calling the function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Passing values by copying tends to end up with code that has fewer bugs. With
    this method of passing values, Go can use its simple memory management system
    called the stack. The downside is that copying uses up more and more memory as
    values get passed from function to function. In real-world code, functions tend
    to be small, and values get passed to lots of functions, so copying by value can
    sometimes end up using much more memory than is needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is an alternative to copying that uses less memory. Instead of passing
    a value, we create something called a pointer and then pass that to functions.
    A pointer is not a value itself, and you can't do anything useful with a pointer
    other than getting a value using it. You can think of a pointer as directions
    to a value you want, and to get to the value, you must follow the directions.
    If you use a pointer, Go won't make a copy of the value when passing a pointer
    to a function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When creating a pointer to a value, Go can't manage the value's memory using
    the stack. This is because the stack relies on simple scope logic to know when
    it can reclaim the memory that's used by a value, and having a pointer to a variable
    means these rules don't work. Instead, Go puts the value on the heap. The heap
    allows the value to exist until no part of your software has a pointer to it anymore.
    Go reclaims these values in what it calls its garbage collection process. This
    garbage collection happens periodically in the background, and you don't need
    to worry about it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having a pointer to a value means that a value is put on the heap, but that's
    not the only reason that happens. Working out whether a value needs to be put
    on the heap is called escape analysis. There are times when a value with no pointers
    is put on the heap, and it's not always clear why.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have no direct control over whether a value is put on the stack or the heap.
    Memory management is not part of Go's language specification. Memory management

- en: While the benefits of using a pointer over a value that gets passed to lots
    of functions are clear for memory usage, it's not so clear for CPU usage. When
    a value gets copied, Go needs CPU cycles to get that memory and then release it
    later. Using a pointer avoids this CPU usage when passing it to a function. On
    the other hand, having a value on the heap means that it then needs to be managed
    by the complex garbage collection process. This process can become a CPU bottleneck
    in certain situations, for example, if there are lots of values on the heap. When
    this happens, the garbage collector has to do lots of checking, which uses up
    CPU cycles. There is no correct answer here, and the best approach is the classic
    performance optimization one. First, don't prematurely optimize. When you do have
    a performance problem, measure before you make a change, and then measure after
    you've made a change.

- en: Beyond performance, you can use pointers to change your code's design. Sometimes,
    using pointers allows a cleaner interface and simplifies your code. For example,
    if you need to know whether a value is present or not, a non-pointer value always
    has at least its zero value, which could be valid in your logic. You can use a
    pointer to allow for an `is not set` state as well as holding a value. This is
    because pointers, as well as holding the address to a value, can also be `nil`,
    which means there is no value. In Go, `nil` is a special type that represents
    something not having a value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ability for a pointer to be nil also means that it's possible to get the
    value of a pointer when it doesn't have a value associated with it, which means
    you'll get a runtime error. To prevent runtime errors, you can compare a pointer
    to nil before trying to get its value. This looks like `<pointer> != nil`. You
    can compare pointers with other pointers of the same type, but they only result
    in true if you are comparing a pointer to itself. No comparison of the associated
    values gets made.

- en: To get a pointer, you have a few options. You can declare a variable as being
    a pointer type using a `var` statement. You can do this by adding an `*` at the
    front of most types. This notation looks like `var <name> *<type>`. The initial
    value of a variable that uses this method is `nil`. You can use the built-in `new`
    function for this. This function is intended to be used to get some memory for
    a type and return a pointer to that address. The notation looks like `<name> :=
    new(<type>).` The `new` function can be used with `var` too. You can also get
    a pointer from an existing variable using `&`. This looks like `<var1> := &<var2>.`

    compiler can't warn you about it, and it happens when the app is running. Therefore,

    it unless you are certain it's not `nil`.

    error if we tried to dereference. `count2` was created using `new`, and its value
    is a zero value for its type. `count3` also had a value that matches the value
    of the variable we got the pointer from. With our `time` variable, we were able

    while the code is running. We declared then using a variety of notation options,
    some with the typeset and some without. We declared a single constant and multiple
    constants in a single statement.

- en: Enums are a way of defining a fixed list of values that are all related. Go
    doesn't have a built-in type for enums, but it does provide tools such as `iota`
    to let you define your own using constants, which we'll explore now.

- en: Scope
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All the variables in Go live in a scope. The top-level scope is the package
    scope. A scope can have child scopes within it. There are a few ways a child scope
    gets defined; the easiest way to think about this is that when you see `{`, you
    are starting a new child scope, and that child scope ends when you get to a matching
    `}`. The parent-child relationship is defined when the code compiles, not when
    the code runs. When accessing a variable, Go looks at the scope the code was defined
    in. If it can't find a variable with that name, it looks in the parent scope,
    then the grandparent scope, all the way until it gets to the package scope. It
    stops looking once it finds a variable with a matching name or raises an error
    if it can't find a match.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To put it another way, when your code uses a variable, Go needs to work out
    where that variable was defined. It starts its search in the scope of the code
    using the variable it's currently running in. If a variable definition using that
    name is in that scope, then it stops looking and uses the variable definition
    to complete its work. If it can't find a variable definition, then it starts walking
    up the stack of scopes, stopping as soon as it finds a variable with that name.
    This searching is all done based on a variable name. If a variable with that name
    is found but is of the wrong type, Go raises an error.

    is not related to the `level` variable in the package scope. When we print `level`
    in the block, the Go runtime stops looking for variables called `level` as soon
    as it finds the one defined in `main`. This logic results in a different value
    getting printed out once that new variable shadows the package variable. You can
    also see that it''s a different variable because it''s a different type, and a
    variable can''t have its type changed in Go:'

    when `funcA` runs, it still sees the package scope `level` variable. The scope
    resolution doesn't pay attention to where `funcA` gets called.

- en: In this chapter, we got into the nitty-gritty of variables, including how variables
    are declared, and all the different notations you can use to declare them. This
    variety of notation gives you a nice compact notation to use for 90% of your work,
    while still giving you the power to be very specific when you need to the other
    10% of the time. We looked at how to change and update the value of variables
    after you've declared them. Again, Go gives you some great shorthand to help in
    the most common use cases to make your life easier. All your data ends up in some
    form of variable. Data is what makes code dynamic and responsive. Without data,
    your code could only ever do exactly one thing; data unleashes the true power
    of software.
  prefs: []

- en: Now that your application has data, it needs to make choices based on that data.
    That's where variable comparison comes in. This helps us see whether something
    is true or false, bigger or smaller, and to make choices based on the results
    of those comparisons.

    zero values, pointers, and scope logic. Now, we know that these are the details
