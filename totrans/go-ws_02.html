			<p class="callout-heading">Overview</p>
			<p class="callout">In this chapter, we'll use branching logic and loops to demonstrate how logic can be controlled and selectively run. With these tools, you'll have control of what you do and don't want to run based on the values of variables.</p>
			<p class="callout">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to implement branching logic using <strong class="source-inline">if</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">else</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong>; use <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements to simplify complex branching logic; create looping logic using a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop; loop over complex data collections using <strong class="source-inline">range</strong>; and use <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> to take control of the flow of loops.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we looked at variables and values and how we can temporarily store data in a variable and make changes to that data. We're now going to look at how we can use that data to run logic, or not, selectively. This logic allows you to control how data flows through your software. You can react to and perform different operations based on the values in your variables.</p>
			<p>The logic could be for validating your user's inputs. If we were writing code to manage a bank account, and the user asked to withdraw some money, we could check that they asked for a valid amount of money. We would check that they had enough money in their account. If the validation was successful, we would use logic to update their balance, transfer the money, and show a success message. If the validation failed, we'd show a message explaining what went wrong.</p>
			<p>If your software is a virtual world, then logic is the physical law of that world. Like the physical laws of our world, those laws must be followed and can't be broken. If you create a law with a flaw in it, then your virtual world won't run smoothly and could even explode.</p>
			<p>Another form of logic is a loop; using loops allows you to execute the same logic multiple times. A common way to use loops is to iterate over a collection of data. For our imaginary banking software, we would use a loop to step over a user's transactions to display them to the user on request.</p>
			<p>Loops and logic allow the software to have complex behavior that responds to changing and dynamic data.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>if Statements</h2>
			<p>An <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement is the most basic form of logic in Go. An <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement either will or won't run a block of logic based on a Boolean expression. The notation looks like this: <strong class="source-inline">if &lt;boolean expression&gt; { &lt;code block&gt; }</strong>.</p>
			<p>The Boolean expression can be a simple code that results in a Boolean value. The code block can be any logic that you could also put in a function. The code block runs when the Boolean expression is true. You can only use <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements in the function scope.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Exercise 2.01: A Simple if Statement</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we'll use an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement to control whether logic will or won't run. We'll define an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> value to check it's hardcoded, but in a real-world application, this could be user input. We'll then check whether the value is an odd or even number using <strong class="source-inline">%</strong> operator, also known as a modulus expression on the variable. The modulus gives you the amount remaining after division. We'll use the modulus to get the remainder after dividing by 2. If we get a remainder of 0, we know the number is even. If the remainder is 1, we know the number is odd. The modulus results in an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>, so we use <strong class="source-inline">==</strong> to get a Boolean value:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a new folder and add a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file.</li>
				<li>In <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong>, add the package and imports:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import "fmt"</p></li>
				<li>Create the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p></li>
				<li>Define an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> variable with an initial value. We are setting it to 5 here, which is an odd number but we could also set it to 6, which is an even number:<p class="source-code">  input := 5</p></li>
				<li>Create an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement that uses a modulus expression; then, check whether the result is equal to 0:<p class="source-code">  if input%2 == 0 {</p></li>
				<li>When the Boolean expression results in <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, that means the number is even. We then print that it's even to the console using the format package:<p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(input, "is even")</p></li>
				<li>Close the code block:<p class="source-code">  }</p></li>
				<li>Now do the same for odd numbers:<p class="source-code">  if input%2 == 1 {</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(input, "is odd")</p><p class="source-code">  }</p></li>
				<li>Close <strong class="source-inline">main</strong>:<p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Save the file, and, in the new folder, <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> the following code snippet:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>The following is the expected output:</p><p class="source-code">5 is odd</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we used logic to run code selectively. Using logic to control what code runs, let's you create flows through your code. This allows you to have code that reacts to its data. These flows allow you to be able to reason about what the code is doing with your data, making it easier to understand and maintain.</p>
			<p>Try changing the value of the input to 6 to see how the even block gets executed instead of the odd block.</p>
			<p>In the next topic, we'll explore how we can improve this code and make it more efficient.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>if else Statements</h2>
			<p>In the previous exercise, we did two evaluations. One evaluation was to check whether the number was even and the other was to see whether it was odd. As we know, a number can only ever be odd or even. With this knowledge, we can use deduction to know that if a number is not even, then it must be odd. </p>
			<p>Using deductive logic like this is common in programming in order to make programs more efficient by not having to do unnecessary work. </p>
			<p>We can represent this kind of logic using an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement. The notation looks like this: <strong class="source-inline">if &lt;boolean expression&gt; { &lt;code block&gt; } else { &lt;code block&gt; }</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement builds on the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement and gives us a second block. The second block only runs if the first block doesn't run; both blocks can't run.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Exercise 2.02: Using an if else Statement</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we'll update our previous exercise to use an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new folder and add a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file.</li>
				<li>In <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong>, add <strong class="source-inline">package</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">import</strong>:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import "fmt"</p></li>
				<li>Create the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p></li>
				<li>Define an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> variable with an initial value, and we'll give it a different value this time:<p class="source-code">  input := 4</p></li>
				<li>Create an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement that uses a modulus expression, and then check whether the result is equal to 0:<p class="source-code">  if input%2 == 0 {</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(input, "is even")</p></li>
				<li>This time, we are not closing the code block but starting a new <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> code block:<p class="source-code">  } else {</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(input, "is odd")</p><p class="source-code">  }</p></li>
				<li>Close <strong class="source-inline">main</strong>:<p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Save the file, and, in the new folder, <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> the following code snippet:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>The following is the expected output:</p><p class="source-code">4 is even</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we were able to simplify our previous code by using an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement. As well as making the code more efficient, it also makes the code easier to understand and maintain. </p>
			<p>In the next topic, we'll demonstrate how we can add as many code blocks as you want while still only letting one execute.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>else if Statements</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> solves the problem of running code for only one or two possible logical outcomes. With that covered, what if our preceding exercise's code was intended to only work for non-negative numbers? We need something that can evaluate more than one Boolean expression but only execute one of the code blocks, that is, the code block for negative numbers, even numbers, or odd numbers.</p>
			<p>In that case, we can't use an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement on its own; however, we could cover it with another extension to <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements. In this extension, you can give the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement its own Boolean expression. This is how the notation looks: <strong class="source-inline">if &lt;boolean expression&gt; { &lt;code block&gt; } else if &lt;boolean expression&gt; { &lt;code block&gt; }</strong>. You can also combine it with a final <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement at the end, which would look like this: <strong class="source-inline">if &lt;boolean expression&gt; { &lt;code block&gt; } else if &lt;boolean expression&gt; { &lt;code block&gt; } else { &lt;code block&gt; }</strong>. After the initial <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement, you can have as many <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements as you need. Go evaluates the Boolean expressions from the top of the statements and works its way through each Boolean expression until one results in <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> or finds an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong>. If there is no <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> and none of the Boolean expressions results in true, then no block is executed and Go moves on. When Go gets a Boolean true result, it executes the code block for that statement only and it then stops evaluating any Boolean expressions of the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Exercise 2.03: Using an else if Statement</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we'll update our previous exercise. We're going to add a check for negative numbers. This check must run before the even and odd checks, as only one of the code blocks can run:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new folder and add a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file.</li>
				<li>In <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong>, add <strong class="source-inline">package</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">import</strong>:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import "fmt"</p></li>
				<li>Create the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p></li>
				<li>Define an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> variable with an initial value, and we'll give it a negative value:<p class="source-code">  input := -10</p></li>
				<li>Our first Boolean expression is to check for negative numbers. If we find a negative number, we'll print a message saying that they are not allowed:<p class="source-code">  if input &lt; 0 {</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println("input can't be a negative number")</p></li>
				<li>We need to move our even check to an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement:<p class="source-code">  } else if input%2 == 0 {</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(input, "is even")</p></li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement stays the same, and we then close <strong class="source-inline">main</strong>:<p class="source-code">  } else {</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(input, "is odd")</p><p class="source-code">  }</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Save the file, and, in the new folder, <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> the following code snippet:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>The following is the expected output:</p><p class="source-code">input can't be a negative number</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we added even more complex logic to our <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement. We added an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement to it, which allowed complex evaluation. This addition took what is usually a simple fork in the road that gives you many roads to go down but still with the restriction of only going down one of them.</p>
			<p>In the next topic, we'll use a subtle but powerful feature of <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements that lets you keep your code nice and tidy.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>The Initial if Statement</h2>
			<p>It's common to need to call a function but not care too much about the returned value. Often, you'll want to check that it executed correctly and then discard the returned value. For example, sending an email, writing to a file, or inserting data into a database; most of the time, if these types of operations execute successfully, you don't need to worry about the variables they return. Unfortunately, the variables don't go anywhere as they are still in scope.</p>
			<p>To stop these unwanted variables from hanging around, we can use what we know about scope rules to get rid of them. The best way to check for errors is to use "initial" statements on <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements. The notation looks like this: <strong class="source-inline">if &lt;initial statement&gt;; &lt;boolean expression&gt; { &lt;code block&gt; }</strong>. The initial statement is in the same section as the Boolean expression, with <strong class="source-inline">;</strong> to divide them.</p>
			<p>Go only allows what it calls simple statements in the initial statement section, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Assignment and short variable assignments:<p class="source-code">E.g.: i := 0</p></li>
				<li>Expressions such as math or logic expressions:<p class="source-code">E.g.: i = (j * 10) == 40</p></li>
				<li>Sending statements for working with channels, which we'll cover later.</li>
				<li>Increment and decrement expressions:<p class="source-code">E.g.: <strong class="source-inline">i++</strong></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A common mistake is trying to define a variable using <strong class="source-inline">var</strong>. That's not allowed; you can use the short assignment in its place.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Exercise 2.04: Implementing the Initial if Statements</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we're going to continue to build on our previous exercises. We're going to add even more rules about what numbers can be checked as to whether they are odd or even. With so many rules, putting them all in a single Boolean expression is hard to understand. We'll move all the validation logic to a function that returns an <strong class="source-inline">error</strong>. This is a built-in Go type used for errors. It the value of the error is <strong class="source-inline">nil</strong>, then everything is okay. If not, you have an error, and you need to deal with it. We'll call the function in our initial statement and then check for errors:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new folder and add a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file.</li>
				<li>In <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong>, add <strong class="source-inline">package</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">import</strong>:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">  "errors"</p><p class="source-code">  "fmt"</p><p class="source-code">)</p></li>
				<li>Create a function to do the validation. This function takes a single integer and returns <strong class="source-inline">error</strong>:<p class="source-code">func validate(input int) error {</p></li>
				<li>We define some rules, and if any are true, we return a new <strong class="source-inline">error</strong> using the <strong class="source-inline">New</strong> function in the <strong class="source-inline">errors</strong> package:<p class="source-code">  if input &lt; 0 {</p><p class="source-code">    return errors.New("input can't be a negative number")</p><p class="source-code">  } else if input &gt; 100 {</p><p class="source-code">    return errors.New("input can't be over 100")</p><p class="source-code">  } else if input%7 == 0 {</p><p class="source-code">    return errors.New("input can't be divisible by 7")</p></li>
				<li>If the input passes all the checks, return <strong class="source-inline">nil</strong>:<p class="source-code">  } else {</p><p class="source-code">    return nil</p><p class="source-code">  }</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Create our <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p></li>
				<li>Define a variable with a value of <strong class="source-inline">21</strong>:<p class="source-code">  input := 21</p></li>
				<li>Call the function using the initial statement; use the short variable assignment to capture the returned error. In the Boolean expression, check that the error is not equal to <strong class="source-inline">nil</strong> using <strong class="source-inline">!=</strong>:<p class="source-code">  if err := validate(input); err != nil {</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(err)</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>The rest is the same as before:<p class="source-code"> else if input%2 == 0 {</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(input, "is even")</p><p class="source-code">  } else {</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(input, "is odd")</p><p class="source-code">  }</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Save the file, and, in the new folder, <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> the following code snippet:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>The following is the expected output which displays an error statement:</p><p class="source-code">input can't be divisible by 7</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we used an initial statement to define and initialize a variable. That variable can be used in the Boolean expression and the related code block. Once the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement completes, the variable goes out of scope and is reclaimed by Go's memory management system.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Activity 2.01: Implementing FizzBuzz</h2>
			<p>When interviewing for a programming job, you'll be asked to do some coding exercises. These questions have you writing something from scratch and will have several rules to follow. To give you an idea of what that looks like, we'll run you through a classic one, "FizzBuzz."</p>
			<p>The rules are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Write a program that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.</li>
				<li>If the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz."</li>
				<li>If the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz."</li>
				<li>If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here are some tips:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can convert a number to a string using <strong class="source-inline">strconv.Itoa()</strong>.</li>
				<li>The first number to evaluate must be 1 and the last number to evaluate must be 100.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These steps will help you to complete the activity:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a loop that does 100 iterations.</li>
				<li>Have a variable that keeps count of the number of loops so far.</li>
				<li>In the loop, use that count and check whether it's divisible by 3 or 5 using <strong class="source-inline">%</strong>.</li>
				<li>Think carefully about how you'll deal with the "FizzBuzz" case.<p>The following screenshot shows the expected output:</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Considering that the output is too big to be displayed here, only a part of it will be visible in <em class="italic">Figure 2.01</em>.</p><div id="_idContainer037" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B14177_02_01.jpg" alt="Figure 2.01: The FizzBuzz output&#13;&#10;"/></div></li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.01: The FizzBuzz output</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The solution for this activity can be found on page 686.</p>
			<p>In the next topic, we'll see how we can tame <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statements that start to get too big.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Expression switch Statements </h2>
			<p>While it's possible to add as many <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements to an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> as you want, at some point, it'll get hard to read. </p>
			<p>When this happens, you can use Go's logic alternative: <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong>. For situations where you would need a big <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement, <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> can be a more compact alternative. </p>
			<p>The notation for <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> is shown in the following code snippet:</p>
			<p class="source-code">switch &lt;initial statement&gt;; &lt;expresion&gt; {</p>
			<p class="source-code">case &lt;expresion&gt;:</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;statements&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">case &lt;expresion&gt;, &lt;expresion&gt;:</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;statements&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">default: </p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;statements&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>The "initial" statement works the same in <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> as it does in the preceding <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements. The expression is not the same because the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> is a Boolean expression. You can have more than just a Boolean in this expression. The cases are where you check to see whether the statements get executed. Statements are like code blocks in <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements, but with no need for the curly brackets here.</p>
			<p>Both the initial statement and expression are optional. To have just the expression, it would look like this: <strong class="source-inline">switch &lt;expresion&gt; {…</strong>. To have only the initial statement, you would write <strong class="source-inline">switch &lt;initial statment&gt;; {…</strong>. You can leave them both off, and you'll end up with <strong class="source-inline">switch {…</strong>. When the expression is missing, it's as if you put the value of <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> there.</p>
			<p>There are two main ways of using case expressions. They can be used just like <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements or Boolean expressions where you use logic to control whether the statements get executed. The alternative is to put a literal value there. In this case, the value is compared to the value in the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression. If they match, then the statements run. You can have as many case expressions as you want by separating them with a<strong class="source-inline">,</strong>. The case expressions get checked from the top case and then from left to right if a case has multiple expressions.</p>
			<p>When a case matches, only its statements are run, which is different from many other languages. To get the fallthrough behavior found in those languages, a <strong class="source-inline">fallthrough</strong> statement must be added to the end of each case where you want that behavior. If you call <strong class="source-inline">fallthrough</strong> before the end of the case, it will fall through at that moment and move on to the next case.</p>
			<p>An optional <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> case can be added anywhere in the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement, but it's best practice to add it to the end. The <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> case works just like using an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement in an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement.</p>
			<p>This form of switch statement is called an "expression <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong>" statement. There is also another form of <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement, called a "type <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong>" statement, which we'll look at in a later chapter.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Exercise 2.05: Using a switch Statement</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we need to create a program that prints a particular message based on the day someone was born. We are using the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package for the set of days of the week constants. We'll use a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement to make a more compact logic structure:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> package:<p class="source-code">package main</p></li>
				<li>Import the <strong class="source-inline">fmt</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> packages:<p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">  "fmt"</p><p class="source-code">  "time"</p><p class="source-code">)</p></li>
				<li>Define the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p></li>
				<li>Define a variable that is the day of the week someone was born. Use the constants from the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package to do it. We'll set it to Monday, but it could be any day:<p class="source-code">  dayBorn := time.Monday</p></li>
				<li>Create a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement that uses the variable as it's expression:<p class="source-code">  switch dayBorn {</p></li>
				<li>Each <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> will try to match its expression value against the switch expression value: <p class="source-code">  case time.Monday:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Monday's child is fair of face")</p><p class="source-code">  case time.Tuesday:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Tuesday's child is full of grace")</p><p class="source-code">  case time.Wednesday:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Wednesday's child is full of woe")</p><p class="source-code">  case time.Thursday:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Thursday's child has far to go")</p><p class="source-code">  case time.Friday:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Friday's child is loving and giving")</p><p class="source-code">  case time.Saturday:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Saturday's child works hard for a living")</p><p class="source-code">  case time.Sunday:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Sunday's child is bonny and blithe")</p></li>
				<li>We'll use the <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> case here as a form of validation:<p class="source-code">  default:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Error, day born not valid")</p><p class="source-code">  }</p></li>
				<li>Close the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Save the file, and, in the new folder, <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> the following code snippet:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>The following is the expected output:</p><p class="source-code">Monday's child is fair of face</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we used <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> to create a compact logic structure that matches lots of different possible values to give a specific message to our users. It's quite common to see <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements used with a constant as we did here, using the day of the week constants from the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package. </p>
			<p>Next, we'll use the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> feature that let's us match multiple values.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Exercise 2.06: switch Statements and Multiple case Values</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we're going to print out a message that tells us whether the day someone was born was a weekday or the weekend. We only need two cases as each case can support checking multiple values: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> package:<p class="source-code">package main</p></li>
				<li>Import the <strong class="source-inline">fmt</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> packages: <p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">  "fmt"</p><p class="source-code">  "time"</p><p class="source-code">)</p></li>
				<li>Define the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p></li>
				<li>Define our <strong class="source-inline">dayBorn</strong> variable using one of the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package's constants:<p class="source-code">  dayBorn := time.Sunday</p></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> starts the same by using the variable as the expression:<p class="source-code">  switch dayBorn {</p></li>
				<li>This time, for <strong class="source-inline">case</strong>, we have weekday constants. Go checks each one against the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression, starting from the left, and sweeps through each one by one. Once Go gets a match, it stops evaluating and runs the statements for that case only:<p class="source-code">  case time.Monday, time.Tuesday, time.Wednesday, time.Thursday, time.Friday:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Born on a weekday")</p></li>
				<li>Then, it does the same for weekend days:<p class="source-code">  case time.Saturday, time.Sunday:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Born on the weekend")</p></li>
				<li>We use <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> for validation again and close out the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement:<p class="source-code">  default:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Error, day born not valid")</p><p class="source-code">  }</p></li>
				<li>Close the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Save the file, and, in the new folder, <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> the following code snippet:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>The following is the expected output:</p><p class="source-code">Born on the weekend</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we used cases with multiple values. This allowed a very compact logic structure that could evaluate 7 days of the week with validation checking in a few lines of code. It makes the intention of the logic clear, which, in turn, makes it easier to change and maintain.</p>
			<p>Next, we'll look at using more complex logic in <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> expressions. </p>
			<p>Sometimes, you'll see code that doesn't evaluate anything in the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement but does checks in the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> expression.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Exercise 2.07: Expressionless switch Statements </h2>
			<p>It's not always possible to be able to match values using the value of the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression. Sometimes, you'll need to match on multiple variables. Sometimes, you'll need to match on something more complicated than an equality check. For example, you may need to check whether a number is in a specific range. In these cases, <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> is still helpful in building compact logic statements, as <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> allows the same range of expressions that you have in <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> Boolean expressions.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, let's build a simple <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression that checks whether a day is a weekend to show what can be done in <strong class="source-inline">case</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> package:<p class="source-code">package main</p></li>
				<li>Import the <strong class="source-inline">fmt</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> packages: <p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">  "fmt"</p><p class="source-code">  "time"</p><p class="source-code">)</p></li>
				<li>Define the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p></li>
				<li>Our <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression is using the initial statement to define our variable. The expression is left empty as we'll not be using it:<p class="source-code">switch dayBorn := time.Sunday; {</p></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">case</strong> is using some complex logic to check whether the day is at the weekend:<p class="source-code">  case dayBorn == time.Sunday || dayBorn == time.Saturday:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Born on the weekend")</p></li>
				<li>Add a <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> statement and close the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression:<p class="source-code">  default:</p><p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Born some other day")</p><p class="source-code">  }</p></li>
				<li>Close the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Save the file, and, in the new folder, <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> the following code snippet:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>The following screenshot shows the expected output:</p><p class="source-code">Born on the weekend</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we learned that you can use complex logic in the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> expression when a simple <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement match is not enough. This still offers a more compact and easier way to manage a logic statement than <strong class="source-inline">if</strong>, if you have more than a couple of cases.</p>
			<p>Next, we'll leave logic structures behind and start to look at ways in which we can run the same statements multiple times to make processing data easier.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Loops</h2>
			<p>In real-world applications, you're often going to need to run the same logic repeatedly. It's common to have to deal with multiple inputs and give multiple outputs. Loops are the simplest way of repeating your logic.</p>
			<p>Go only has one looping statement, <strong class="source-inline">for</strong>, but it's a flexible one. There are two distinct forms: the first is used a lot for ordered collections such as arrays and slices, which we'll cover more later. The sort of loop used for ordered collections looks as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">for &lt;initial statement&gt;; &lt;condition&gt;; &lt;post statement&gt; {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;statements&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">initial</strong> statement is just like the one found in <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements. <strong class="source-inline">initial</strong> statement runs before everything else and allows the same simple statements that we defined before. The condition is checked before each loop to see whether the statements should be run or whether the loop should stop. Like <strong class="source-inline">initial</strong> statement, <strong class="source-inline">condition</strong> also allows simple statements. The <strong class="source-inline">post</strong> statement is run after the statements are run at the end of each loop and allow you to run simple statements. The <strong class="source-inline">post</strong> statement is mostly used for incrementing things such as loop counters, which get evaluated on the next loop by <strong class="source-inline">condition</strong>. The statements are any Go code you want to run as part of the loop.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">initial</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">condition</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">post</strong> statements are all optional, and it's possible to write a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">for {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;statements&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>This form would result in a loop that would run forever, also known as an infinite loop, unless the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement is used to stop the loop manually. In addition to <strong class="source-inline">break</strong>, there is also a <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> statement that can be used to skip the remainder of an individual run of a loop but doesn't stop the whole loop.</p>
			<p>Another form the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop can take is when reading from a source of data that returns a Boolean when there is more data to read. Examples of this include when reading from databases, files, command-line inputs, and network sockets. This form looks like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">for &lt;condition&gt; {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;statements&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>This form is just a simplified version of the form used to read from an ordered list but without the logic needed to control the loop yourself, as the source you're using is built to work easily in <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loops. </p>
			<p>The other form that the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop takes is when looping over unordered data collections such as maps. We'll cover what maps are in more detail in a later chapter. When looping over these, you'll use the <strong class="source-inline">range</strong> statement in your loop. With maps, the form looks like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">for &lt;key&gt;, &lt;value&gt; := range &lt;map&gt; {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  &lt;statements&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Exercise 2.08: Using the for i Loop</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we'll use the three parts of the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop to create a variable and use a variable in the loop. We'll be able to see how the variable changes after each iteration of the loop by printing out its value to the console:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Define <strong class="source-inline">package</strong> as <strong class="source-inline">main </strong>and add imports:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import "fmt"</p></li>
				<li>Create the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p></li>
				<li>Define a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop that defines the <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> variable with an initial value of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">initial</strong> statement section. In the clause, check that <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is less than <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>. In for the post statement, increment <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> by <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>:<p class="source-code">  for i := 0; i &lt; 5; i++ {</p></li>
				<li>In the body of the loop, print out the value of <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>:<p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(i)</p></li>
				<li>Close the loop:<p class="source-code">  }</p></li>
				<li>Close <strong class="source-inline">main</strong>:<p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Save the file, and, in the new folder, <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> the following code snippet:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>The following is the expected output:</p><p class="source-code">0</p><p class="source-code">1</p><p class="source-code">2</p><p class="source-code">3</p><p class="source-code">4</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we used a variable that only exists in the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. We set up the variable, checked its value, modified it, and output it. Using a loop like this is very common when working with ordered, numerically indexed collections such as arrays and slices. In this instance, we hardcoded the value for when to stop looping; however, when looking over arrays and slices, that value would be determined dynamically from the size of the collection.</p>
			<p>Next, we'll use a <strong class="source-inline">for i</strong> loop to work with a slice.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Exercise 2.09: Looping Over Arrays and Slices</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we'll loop over a collection of strings. We'll be using a slice, but the loop logic will also be the same set of arrays. We'll define the collection; we'll then create a loop that uses the collection to control when to stop looping and a variable to keep track of where we are in the collection.</p>
			<p>The way the index of arrays and slices works means that there are never any gaps in the number, and the first number is always 0. The built-in function, <strong class="source-inline">len</strong>, is used to get the length of any collection. We'll use it as part of the condition to check when we've reached the end of the collection:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new folder and add a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file.</li>
				<li>In <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong>, add <strong class="source-inline">package</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">import</strong>:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import "fmt"</p></li>
				<li>Create the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p></li>
				<li>Define a variable which is a slice of "strings" and initialize it with data:<p class="source-code">  names := []string{"Jim", "Jane", "Joe", "June"}</p><p>We will cover <strong class="source-inline">collection</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">string</strong> in more detail in the next chapter.</p></li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">initial</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">post</strong> statements for the loop are the same as before; the difference is in the <strong class="source-inline">condition</strong>, where we use <strong class="source-inline">len</strong> to check whether we are at the end of the collection:<p class="source-code">  for i := 0; i &lt; len(names); i++ {</p></li>
				<li>The rest is the same as before:<p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(names[i])</p><p class="source-code">  }</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Save the file, and, in the new folder, <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> the following code snippet:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>The following is the expected output:</p><p class="source-code">Jim</p><p class="source-code">Jane</p><p class="source-code">Joe</p><p class="source-code">June</p></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>The range Loop</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">array</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">slice</strong> types always have the number of an index, and that number always starts at <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">for i</strong> loop we've seen so far is the most common choice you'll see in real-world code for these types.</p>
			<p>The other collection type, <strong class="source-inline">map</strong>, doesn't give the same guarantee. That means you need to use <strong class="source-inline">range</strong>. You'll use <strong class="source-inline">range</strong> instead of the <strong class="source-inline">condition</strong> of a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, and, on each loop, <strong class="source-inline">range</strong> yields both a key and a value of an element in the collection, then, moves on to the next element.</p>
			<p>With a <strong class="source-inline">range</strong> loop, you don't need to define a condition to stop the loop as <strong class="source-inline">range</strong> takes care of that for us.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Callout map Order</strong>: The order of items is randomized to stop developers relying on the order of the elements in a map, which means you can use it as a form of pseudo data randomization if needed.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Exercise 2.10: Looping Over a Map</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we're going to create a <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> that has a string for its key and a string for the values. We'll cover <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> types in more detail in a later chapter, so don't worry if you don't quite get what <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> types are yet. We'll then use <strong class="source-inline">range</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop to iterate over the map. We'll then write out the key and value data to the console:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new folder and add a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file.</li>
				<li>In <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong>, add the <strong class="source-inline">package</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">import</strong>:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import "fmt"</p></li>
				<li>Create the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function: <p class="source-code">func main() {</p></li>
				<li>Define a <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> with a <strong class="source-inline">string</strong> key and a <strong class="source-inline">string</strong> value of strings variable and initialize it with the data:<p class="source-code">  config := map[string]string{</p><p class="source-code">  "debug":  "1",</p><p class="source-code">  "logLevel": "warn",</p><p class="source-code">  "version":  "1.2.1",</p><p class="source-code">  }</p></li>
				<li>Use <strong class="source-inline">range</strong> to get the <strong class="source-inline">key</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">value</strong> for an array element and assign them to variables:<p class="source-code">  for key, value := range config {</p></li>
				<li>Print out the <strong class="source-inline">key</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">value</strong> variables:<p class="source-code">  fmt.Println(key, "=", value)</p></li>
				<li>Close the loop and <strong class="source-inline">main</strong>:<p class="source-code">  }</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Save the file, and, in the new folder, <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> the following code snippet:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>The following is the expected output displaying a map that has a string for its key and a string for the values:</p><p class="source-code">debug = 1</p><p class="source-code">logLevel = warn</p><p class="source-code">version = 1.2.1</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we used <strong class="source-inline">range</strong> in a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop to allow us to read out all the data from a <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> collection. Even though we used an integer for the <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> variable's key, <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> types don't give guarantees like arrays and slices do about starting at zero and having no gaps. <strong class="source-inline">range</strong> also controls when to stop the loop.</p>
			<p>If you don't need the <strong class="source-inline">key</strong> or the <strong class="source-inline">value</strong> variable, you can use <strong class="source-inline">_</strong> as the variable name to tell the compiler you don't want it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83">A<a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>ctivity 2.02: Looping Over Map Data Using range</h2>
			<p>Suppose you have been provided with the data in the following table. You have to find the word with the maximum count and print the word and its count using the following data:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer038" class="IMG---Figure">

			</ol>
			<p>Next, we'll look at how we can take manual control of the loop by skipping iterations or stopping the loop.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>break and continue</h2>
			<p>There are going to be times when you need to skip a single loop or stop the loop from running altogether. It's possible to do this with variables and <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements, but there is an easier way.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> keyword stops the execution of the current loop and starts a new loop. The <strong class="source-inline">post</strong> loop logic runs, and the loop <strong class="source-inline">condition</strong> gets evaluated.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> keyword also stops the execution of the current loop and it stops any new loops from running.</p>
			<p>Use <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> when you want to skip a single item in a collection; for instance, perhaps it's okay if one of the items in a collection is invalid, but the rest may be okay to process. Use <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> when you need to stop processing when there are any errors in the data and there's no value in processing the rest of the collection.</p>
			<p>Here, we have an example that generates a random number between <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">8</strong>. The loop skips on a number divisible by <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> and stops on a number divisible by <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>. It also prints out the <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> variable for each loop to help us see that <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> are stopping the execution of the rest of the loop.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Exercise 2.11: Using break and continue to Control Loops</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we'll use <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> in a loop to show you how you can take control of it. We're going to create a loop that keeps going forever. This means we have to stop it with <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> manually. We'll also randomly skip loops with <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong>. We'll do this skipping by generating a random number, and if that number is divisible by 3, we'll skip the rest of the loop:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new folder and add a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file.</li>
				<li>In <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong>, add <strong class="source-inline">package</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">import</strong>:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">  "fmt"</p><p class="source-code">  "math/rand"</p><p class="source-code">)</p></li>
				<li>Create the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p></li>
				<li>Create an empty <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. This will loop forever if you don't stop it:<p class="source-code">  for {</p></li>
				<li>Use <strong class="source-inline">Intn</strong> from the <strong class="source-inline">rand</strong> package to pick a random number between 0 and 8:<p class="source-code">    r := rand.Intn(8)</p></li>
				<li>If the random number is divisible by 3, print <strong class="source-inline">"Skip"</strong> and skip the rest of the loop using <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong>:<p class="source-code">    if r%3 == 0 {</p><p class="source-code">      fmt.Println("Skip")</p><p class="source-code">      continue</p></li>

				<li>If the number is neither of those things, then print the number:<p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(r)</p></li>
				<li>Close the loop and <strong class="source-inline">main</strong>:<p class="source-code">  }</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Save the file, and, in the new folder, <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> the following code snippet:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>The following is the expected output displaying random numbers, <strong class="source-inline">Skip</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Stop</strong>:</p><p class="source-code">1</p><p class="source-code">7</p><p class="source-code">7</p><p class="source-code">Skip</p><p class="source-code">1</p><p class="source-code">Skip</p><p class="source-code">1</p><p class="source-code">Stop</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we created a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop that would loop forever, and we then used <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> to override normal loop behavior to take control of it ourselves. The ability to do this can allow us to reduce the number of nested <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements and variables needed to prevent logic from running when it shouldn't. Using <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> help to clean up your code and make it easier to work on.</p>
			<p>If you use an empty <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop like this, the loop continues forever, and you must use <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> to prevent an infinite loop. An infinite loop is a loop in your code that never stops. Once you get an infinite loop, you'll need a way to kill your application; how you do that will depend on your operating system. If you are running your app in a terminal, closing the terminal normally does the trick. Don't panic – it happens to us all – your system may slow down, but it won't do it any harm.</p>
			<p>Next, we'll work on some activities to test out all your new knowledge about logic and loops.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Activity 2.03: Bubble Sort</h2>
			<p>In this activity, we'll sort a given slice of numbers by swapping the values. This technique of sorting is known as the <strong class="bold">bubble sort</strong> technique. Go has built-in sorting algorithms in the <strong class="source-inline">sort</strong> package but I don't want you to use them; we want you to use the logic and loops you've just learned.</p>
			<p>Steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Define a slice with unsorted numbers in it.</li>
				<li>Print this slice to the console.</li>
				<li>Sort the values using swapping.</li>
				<li>Once done, print the now sorted numbers to the console.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Tips:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can do an in-place swap in Go using:<p class="source-code">nums[i], nums[i-1] = nums[i-1], nums[i]</p></li>
				<li>You can create a new slice using: <p class="source-code">var nums2 []int</p></li>
				<li>You can add to the end of a slice using:<p class="source-code">nums2 = append(nums2, 1)</p><p>The following is the expected output:</p><p class="source-code">Before: [5, 8, 2, 4, 0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 6]</p><p class="source-code">After : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">The solution for this activity can be found on page 690.</p></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed log<a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>ic and loops. These are the foundational building blocks to build complex software. They allow you to have data flow through your code. They let you deal with collections of data by letting you execute the same logic on every element of the data.</p>
			<p>Being able to define the rules and laws of your code are the starting points of codifying the real world in software. If you are creating banking software and the bank has rules about what you can and can't do with money, then you can also define those rules in your code.</p>
			<p>Logic and loops are the essential tools that you'll use to build all your software.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we'll look at Go's type system and the core types it has available.</p>
