			<p class="callout-heading">Overview</p>
			<p class="callout">This chapter introduces you to the Go features that will allow you to perform concurrent work, or, in other words, achieve concurrency. The first feature you will learn is called a Goroutine. You'll learn what a Goroutine is and how you can use it to achieve concurrency. Then, you'll learn how to utilize WaitGroups to synchronize the execution of several Goroutines. You will also learn how to implement synchronized and thread-safe changes to variables shared across different Goroutines using atomic changes. To synchronize more complex changes, you will work with mutexes.</p>
			<p class="callout">Later in the chapter, you will experiment with the functionalities of channels and use message tracking to track the completion of a task.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-367"><a id="_idTextAnchor410"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>There is software that's meant to be used by a single user, and most of what you've learned so far in this book allows you to develop such applications. There is other software, however, that is meant to be used by several users at the same time. An example of this is a web server. You created web servers in <em class="italic">Chapter 15, HTTP Servers</em>. They are designed to serve websites or web applications that are generally used by thousands of users at the same time.</p>
			<p>When multiple users are accessing a web server, it sometimes needs to perform a series of actions that are totally independent and whose result is the only thing that matters to the final output. All these situations call for a type of programming in which different tasks can be executed at the same time, independently from each other. Some languages allow parallel computation, where tasks are computed simultaneously. However, in some languages, such as Go, tasks are accomplished by the machine one piece per task; that is, each task, or process, is split into small pieces, and the program will execute a small piece of task at a time, until all the tasks are completed. This is known as concurrent programming.</p>
			<p>In concurrent programming, when a task starts, all the other tasks start as well, but instead of completing them one by one, the machine performs a bit of each task at the same time. While Go allows concurrent programming, tasks can also be performed in parallel when the machine has multiple cores. From the perspective of the programmer, however, this distinction is not that important, as the tasks are created with the idea that they will be performed in parallel, and in whatever way the machine will perform them. Let's find out more in this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-368"><a id="_idTextAnchor411"/>Goroutines</h1>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor412"/>Imagine several people have some nails to hammer into a wall. Each person has a different number of nails and a different area of the wall, but there is only one hammer. Each person uses the hammer for one nail, then passes the hammer to the next person, and so on. The person with the fewest nails will finish earlier but they will all share the same hammer; this is how Goroutines work.</p>
			<p>Using Goroutines, Go allows multiple tasks to run at the same time (they are also called coroutines). These are routines (read tasks) that can co-run inside the same process but are totally concurrent. Goroutines do not share memory, which is why they are different from threads. However, we will see how easy it is to pass variables across them in your code, and how this might lead to some unexpected behavior.</p>
			<p>Writing a Goroutine is nothing special; they are just normal functions. Actually, each function can easily become a Goroutine; all we have to do is to write the word <strong class="source-inline">go</strong> before calling the function.</p>
			<p>Let's consider a function called <strong class="source-inline">hello</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">func hello() {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("hello world")</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>In order to call our function as a Goroutine, we do the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">go hello()</p>
			<p>The function will run as a Goroutine. What this means can be understood better through the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">func main() {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("Start")</p>
			<p class="source-code">  go hello()</p>
			<p class="source-code">  fmt.Println("End")</p>
			<p>The code starts by printing <strong class="source-inline">Start</strong>, then it calls the <strong class="source-inline">hello()</strong> function. Then, the execution goes straight to printing <strong class="source-inline">End</strong> without waiting for the <strong class="source-inline">hello()</strong> function to complete. No matter how long it takes to run the <strong class="source-inline">hello()</strong> function, the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function will not care about the <strong class="source-inline">hello()</strong> function as these functions will run independently. In order to better understand how this works, let's do some exercises.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The important thing to remember is that Go is not a parallel language, but concurrent, which means that Goroutines do not work in an independent manner, but each Goroutine is split into smaller parts and each Goroutine runs one of its subparts at a time.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-369"><a id="_idTextAnchor413"/>Exercise 16.01: Using Concurrent Routines</h2>
			<p>Let's imagine we want to make two calculations. First, we sum all the numbers from <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">10</strong>, then the numbers from <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">100</strong>. In order to save time, we want to make both of these calculations happen independently and see both results at the same time.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a new folder in your filesystem, and, inside it, create a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file and write the following:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import "fmt"</p></li>
				<li>Create a function to sum two numbers:<p class="source-code">func sum(from,to int) int {</p><p class="source-code">    res := 0</p><p class="source-code">    for i:=from;i&lt;=to; i++ {</p><p class="source-code">        res += i</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p class="source-code">    return res</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>This accepts two integers as extremes (the minimum and maximum of an interval) and returns the sum of all the numbers in the range between these two extremes.</p></li>
				<li>Create the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function, which sums the numbers <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">100</strong>, then print the result:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    s1 := sum(1,100)</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(s1)</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Run the program:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>You will see the following output:</p><p class="source-code">5050 55</p></li>
				<li>Now, let's introduce some concurrency. Modify the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function to look like this:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    var s1 int</p><p class="source-code">    go func() {</p><p class="source-code">        s1 = sum(1,100)</p><p class="source-code">    }()</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(s1)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>Here, we are running an anonymous function that assigns the value <strong class="source-inline">s1</strong> to the sum as before, but, if we run the code, the result will be <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. If you try to remove the term <strong class="source-inline">go</strong> before the <strong class="source-inline">func()</strong> part, you will see that the result is <strong class="source-inline">5050</strong>. In this case, the anonymous function will run and start summing the numbers, but then there is a call to <strong class="source-inline">fmt.Println</strong>, which prints the value of <strong class="source-inline">s1</strong>. Here, the program waits for the <strong class="source-inline">sum()</strong> function to end before printing the value of <strong class="source-inline">s1</strong>, hence returning the correct result. </p><p>If we call the function and prepend the <strong class="source-inline">go</strong> word, the program prints the current value of <strong class="source-inline">s1</strong> while the function is still computing the sum, which is still <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, and terminates.</p><p>Let's call the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> function twice with two different ranges. Modify the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function:</p><p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    var s1,s2 int</p><p class="source-code">    go func() {</p><p class="source-code">        s1 = sum(1,100)</p><p class="source-code">    }()</p><p class="source-code">    s2 = sum(1,10)</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(s1, s2)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>If you run this program, it will print the numbers <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">55</strong>. This is because the concurrent function, <strong class="source-inline">go func()</strong>, does not have the time to return the result. The <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function is faster as it just has to count to <strong class="source-inline">55</strong> and not <strong class="source-inline">5050</strong>, so the program terminates before the concurrent function is finished. </p><p>To solve this problem, we want to find a way to wait for the <em class="italic">concurrent </em>function to finish. There are some correct ways to do this but, for now, let's do something quite crude but effective, which is to wait for a fixed amount of time. In order to do so, just add this line before the <strong class="source-inline">fmt.Println</strong> command:</p><p class="source-code">time.Sleep(time.Second)</p></li>
				<li>If your IDE does not do it for you, modify the <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> section, just below the <strong class="source-inline">package main</strong> instruction, to look as follows:<p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">    "log"</p><p class="source-code">    "time"</p><p class="source-code">)</p><p>If you run your program now, you should see <strong class="source-inline">5050 55</strong> printed on the screen.</p></li>
				<li>In the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function, write code for the log to be printed:<p class="source-code">log.Println(s1, s2)</p></li>
				<li>If you run your program now, you will see the same output again, <strong class="source-inline">5050</strong> <strong class="source-inline">55</strong>, but prepended by a timestamp representing when you ran the code:<p class="source-code">2019/10/28 19:23:00 5050 55</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you can see, the calculations have happened concurrently, and we have received both the outputs at the same time.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The full code for this exercise is available at: <a href="https://packt.live/2Qek69K"><span class="Hyperlink">https://packt.live/2Qek69K</span></a></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-370"><a id="_idTextAnchor414"/>WaitGroup</h1>
			<p>In the previous exercise, we used a not-so-elegant method to ensure that the Goroutine ends by making the main routine wait for a second. The important thing to understand is that even if a program does not explicitly use Goroutines via the <strong class="source-inline">go</strong> call, it still uses one Goroutine, which is the main routine. When we run our program and create a new Goroutine, we are running two Goroutines: the main one and the one we just created. In order to synchronize these two Goroutines, Go gives us a function called <strong class="source-inline">WaitGroup</strong>. You can define a WaitGroup using the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">wg := sync.WaitGroup{}</p>
			<p>WaitGroup needs the <strong class="source-inline">sync</strong> package to be imported. A typical code using the WaitGroup will be something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">package main</p>
			<p class="source-code">import "sync"</p>
			<p class="source-code">func main() {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  wg := &amp;sync.WaitGroup{}</p>
			<p class="source-code">  wg.Add(1)</p>
			<p class="source-code">  …………………..</p>
			<p class="source-code">  wg.Wait()</p>
			<p class="source-code">  ………….</p>
			<p class="source-code">  ………….</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>Here, we create a pointer to a new WaitGroup, then we mention that we are adding an asynchronous operation that adds 1 to the group using <strong class="source-inline">wg.Add(1)</strong>. This is essentially a counter holding the number of all the concurrent routines that are running. Later, we add the code that will actually run the concurrent call. At the end, we tell the WaitGroup to wait for the Goroutines to end using <strong class="source-inline">wg.Wait()</strong>.</p>
			<p>How does the wait group know that the routines are complete? Well, we need to explicitly tell the WaitGroup about it inside the Goroutine with the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">wg.Done()</p>
			<p>This must be inside the main Goroutine function, which means it needs a reference to the WaitGroup. We will see this in the next exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-371"><a id="_idTextAnchor415"/>Exercise 16.02: Experimenting with WaitGroup</h2>
			<p>Let's say we calculate the addition in <em class="italic">Exercise 16.01</em>, <em class="italic">Using Concurrent Routines</em>, again using a Goroutine that runs concurrently with the main process. However, this time, we want to use a <strong class="source-inline">WaitGroup</strong> to synchronize the results. We have a few changes to make. Essentially, the <strong class="source-inline">sum()</strong> function needs to accept a new parameter for the <strong class="source-inline">WaitGroup</strong>, and there is no need to use the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new folder and a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file inside it. The package and import parts of your file will be as follows:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">    "log"</p><p class="source-code">    "sync"</p><p class="source-code">)</p><p>Here, we just define the package as the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> package, and then we import the <strong class="source-inline">log</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">sync</strong> packages. <strong class="source-inline">log</strong> will be used again to print out messages and <strong class="source-inline">sync</strong> will be used for the <strong class="source-inline">WaitGroup</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>Next, write the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func sum(from,to int, wg *sync.WaitGroup, res *int) {</p><p>Now, we add a parameter called <strong class="source-inline">wg</strong> with a pointer to the <strong class="source-inline">sync.WaitGroup</strong> along with the result parameter. In the previous exercise, we wrapped the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> function with an anonymous function that ran as a Goroutine. Here, we want to avoid that, but we need to somehow get the result of the <strong class="source-inline">sum </strong>function. Hence, we pass an extra parameter as a pointer that will return the correct value.</p></li>
				<li>Create a loop to increment the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> function:<p class="source-code">*res = 0</p><p class="source-code">for i:=from;i&lt;=to; i++ {</p><p class="source-code">    *res += i</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>Here, we set the value of what is held by the <strong class="source-inline">res</strong> pointer to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, then we just use the same loop that we saw earlier, but again associating the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> with the value pointed by the <strong class="source-inline">res</strong> parameter.</p></li>
				<li>We can now complete this function:<p class="source-code">wg.Done()</p><p class="source-code">  return</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>Here, we tell the <strong class="source-inline">WaitGroup</strong> that this Goroutine is completed and then we return.</p></li>
				<li>Now, let's write the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function, which will set up the variables and then run the Goroutine that calculates the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong>. We will then wait for the Goroutine to finish and display the result:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    s1 := 0</p><p class="source-code">    wg := &amp;sync.WaitGroup{}</p><p>Here, the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function is defined, and then a variable called <strong class="source-inline">s1</strong> is set to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. Also, a pointer to the WaitGroup is created.</p></li>
				<li>Add one to the count of the WaitGroup and then run the Goroutine:<p class="source-code">    wg.Add(1)</p><p class="source-code">    go sum(1,100, wg, &amp;s1)</p><p>This code notifies the WaitGroup that there is one Goroutine running and then creates a new Goroutine calculating the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">sum()</strong> function will call the<strong class="source-inline">.Done()</strong> method to notify the <strong class="source-inline">WaitGroup</strong> of its completion.</p></li>
				<li>We need to wait for the Goroutine to finish. To do so, write the following:<p class="source-code">    wg.Wait()</p><p class="source-code">    log.Println(s1)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>This also logs the result to the standard output.</p></li>
				<li>Run the program:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>You will see the log output for the function using WaitGroups, as follows, with the timestamp:</p><p class="source-code">2019/10/28 19:24:51 5050</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>With this exercise, we have explored the functionality of <strong class="source-inline">WaitGroup</strong> by synchronizing Goroutines in our code.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-372"><a id="_idTextAnchor416"/>Race Conditions</h1>
			<p>One important thing to consider is that whenever we run multiple functions concurrently, we have no guarantee in what order each instruction in each function will be performed. In many architectures, this is not a problem. Some functions are not connected in any way with other functions, and whatever a function does in its routine does not affect the actions performed in other routines. This is, however, not always true. The first situation we can think of is when some functions need to share the same parameter. Some functions will just read from this parameter, while others will write to this parameter. As we do not know which operation will run first, there is a high likelihood that one function will override the value updated by another function. Let's see an example that explains this situation:</p>
			<p class="source-code">func next(v *int) {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  c := *v</p>
			<p class="source-code">  *v = c+1</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>This function takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter. It is a pointer because we want to run several Goroutines with the <strong class="source-inline">next</strong> function and update <strong class="source-inline">v</strong>. If we run the following code, we would expect that <strong class="source-inline">a</strong> will hold the value 3:</p>
			<p class="source-code">a := 0</p>
			<p class="source-code">next(&amp;a)</p>
			<p class="source-code">next(&amp;a)</p>
			<p class="source-code">next(&amp;a)</p>
			<p>This is perfectly fine. However, what if we run the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">a := 0</p>
			<p class="source-code">go next(&amp;a)</p>
			<p class="source-code">go next(&amp;a)</p>
			<p class="source-code">go next(&amp;a)</p>
			<p>In this case, we might see that <strong class="source-inline">a</strong> holds 3, or 2, or 1. Why would this happen? Because when a function executes the following statement, the value of <strong class="source-inline">v</strong> might be 0 for all the functions running in independent Goroutines:</p>
			<p class="source-code">c := *v</p>
			<p>If this happens, then each function will set <strong class="source-inline">v</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">c+1</strong>, which means none of the routines are aware of what the other routines are doing and override any changes made by another routine. This problem is called a <em class="italic">race condition</em> and happens every time we work with shared resources without taking precautions. Fortunately, we have several ways to prevent this situation and to make sure that the same change is made only once. We will look at these solutions in the next sections, and we will explore the situation we just described in more detail, with a proper solution and race detection.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-373"><a id="_idTextAnchor417"/>Atomic Operations</h1>
			<p>Let's imagine we want to run independent functions again. However, in this case, we want to modify the value held by a variable. We still want to sum the numbers from 1 to 100, but we want to split the work into two concurrent Goroutines. We can sum the numbers from 1 to 50 in one routine and the numbers from 51 to 100 in another routine. At the end, we will need still to receive the value of 5050, but two different routines can add a number at the same time to the same variable. Let's see an example with only 4 numbers where we want to sum 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the result is 10. </p>
			<p>Think of it like having a variable called <strong class="source-inline">s:=0</strong> and then making a loop where the value of <strong class="source-inline">s</strong> becomes the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">s=0</p>
			<p class="source-code">s=1</p>
			<p class="source-code">s=3 //(1+2)</p>
			<p class="source-code">s=6</p>
			<p class="source-code">s=10</p>
			<p>However, we could also have the following loop. In this case, the order in which the numbers are summed is different:</p>
			<p class="source-code">S=0</p>
			<p class="source-code">s=1</p>
			<p class="source-code">s=4 //3+1, the previous value of 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">s=6 //2+4 the previous value of 4</p>
			<p class="source-code">s=10</p>
			<p>Essentially, this is just the commutative property of the sum, but this gives us a hint that we can actually split the sum into two or more concurrent calls. The problem that arises here is that all the functions need to manipulate the same variable, <strong class="source-inline">s</strong>, which can lead to <em class="italic">race conditions</em> and incorrect final values. A <em class="italic">race condition</em> happens when two processes change the same variable and one process overrides the changes made by another process without taking into account the previous change. Thankfully, we have a package called <em class="italic">atomic</em>, which allows us to safely modify variables across Goroutines. </p>
			<p>We will take a look at how this package works soon, but, for now, all you need to know is that this package has some functions for executing simple concurrent safe operations on variables. Let's look at an example:</p>
			<p class="source-code">func AddInt32(addr *int32, delta int32) (new int32)</p>
			<p>This code takes a pointer to <strong class="source-inline">int32</strong> and modifies it by adding the value it points at to the value of <strong class="source-inline">delta</strong>. If <strong class="source-inline">addr</strong> holds a value of 2 and <strong class="source-inline">delta</strong> is 4, after calling this function, <strong class="source-inline">addr</strong> will hold 6.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-374"><a id="_idTextAnchor418"/>Exercise 16.03: An Atomic Change</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we want to calculate the sum of all the numbers between 1 and 100 but with more concurrent Goroutines, let's say 4. So, we have one function summing in the range of 1-25, one in the range of 26-50, then 51-75, and finally 76-100. We will use what we've learned about atomic operations and WaitGroups.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new folder and a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file. Inside it, write the following code:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">    "log"</p><p class="source-code">    "sync"</p><p class="source-code">    "sync/atomic"</p><p class="source-code">)</p><p>This will import the same packages used for the previous exercises, in addition to the <strong class="source-inline">sync/atomic</strong> package.</p></li>
				<li>The next step is to refactor the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> function from <em class="italic">Exercise 16.02</em>, <em class="italic">Experimenting with WaitGroup</em>, to use the <strong class="source-inline">atomic</strong> package:<p class="source-code">func sum(from,to int, wg *sync.WaitGroup, res *int32) {</p><p>Here, we just changed <strong class="source-inline">res</strong> from <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">*int32</strong>. The reason for this is that the <strong class="source-inline">atomic</strong> operations available specifically for arithmetic operations only work on <strong class="source-inline">int32/64</strong> and relative <strong class="source-inline">uint32/64</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>At this point, write a loop to add each number to the total:<p class="source-code">    for i:=from;i&lt;=to; i++ {</p><p class="source-code">        atomic.AddInt32(res, int32(i))</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p class="source-code">    wg.Done()</p><p class="source-code">    return</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>As you can see, instead of assigning the value of <strong class="source-inline">res</strong> as <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, we are now adding <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> to the total value held by <strong class="source-inline">res</strong>. The rest of the code is unchanged.</p></li>
				<li>The next step is to write the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function to calculate the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> in four different Goroutines:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    s1 := int32(0)</p><p class="source-code">    wg := &amp;sync.WaitGroup{}</p><p>Here, we set <strong class="source-inline">s1</strong> to an <strong class="source-inline">int32</strong> type rather than <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> so we can send it as a parameter to the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> function. Then we create the pointer to WaitGroup.</p></li>
				<li>Now, tell the WaitGroup that we will have four Goroutines running:<p class="source-code">wg.Add(4)</p></li>
				<li>Now, run four Goroutines performing the sum over four ranges: 1-25, 26-50, 51-75, and 76-100:<p class="source-code">    go sum(1,25, wg, &amp;s1)</p><p class="source-code">    go sum(26,50, wg, &amp;s1)</p><p class="source-code">    go sum(51,75, wg, &amp;s1)</p><p class="source-code">    go sum(76,100, wg, &amp;s1)</p></li>
				<li>Now, add the code that waits for the routines to complete and print the result:<p class="source-code">    wg.Wait()</p><p class="source-code">    log.Println(s1)</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Now, if you run the code with the following:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>You will see something like this:</p><p class="source-code">2019/10/28 19:26:04 5050</p><p>The actual date will be different because it depends on when you run this code.</p></li>
				<li>Now, let's test the code. We will use it in order to show you what it means to have a race condition, and why we use this atomic package, and what concurrency safety is. Here is the test code:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">    "bytes"</p><p class="source-code">    "log"</p><p class="source-code">    "testing"</p><p class="source-code">)</p><p class="source-code">func Test_Main(t *testing.T) {</p><p class="source-code">    for i:=0;i &lt; 10000; i++ {</p><p class="source-code">        var s bytes.Buffer</p><p class="source-code">        log.SetOutput(&amp;s)</p><p class="source-code">        log.SetFlags(0)</p><p class="source-code">        main()</p><p class="source-code">        if s.String() != "5050\n" {</p><p class="source-code">            t.Error(s.String())</p><p class="source-code">        }</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>We will run the same test 10,000 times.</p></li>
				<li>Run your test:<p class="source-code">go test</p><p>The result of the test on atomic changes is as follows:</p><p class="source-code">PASS</p><p class="source-code">Ok    parallelwork/ex3    0.048s</p></li>
				<li>And now add the <strong class="source-inline">race</strong> flag:<p class="source-code">go test -race</p><p>The output when running these tests with the <strong class="source-inline">race</strong> flag is as follows:</p><p class="source-code">PASS</p><p class="source-code">Ok    parallelwork/ex3    3.417s</p><p>Again, everything is fine so far.</p></li>
				<li>Let's now remove the <strong class="source-inline">sync/atomic</strong> import and modify the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> function where you see this line:<p class="source-code">atomic.AddInt32(res, int32(i))</p></li>
				<li>Change it to this:<p class="source-code">*res = *res + int32(i)</p></li>
				<li>Now run your program:<p class="source-code"><a id="_idTextAnchor419"/>go run main.go</p></li>
				<li>The log output for a non-atomic change stays the same when using pointers:<p class="source-code">2019/10/28 19:30:47 5050</p></li>
				<li>But if you try running the test multiple times, you may see some different results, even though, in this case, that is quite unlikely. At this point, however, try running the tests with the <strong class="source-inline">-race</strong> flag:<p class="source-code">go test -race main.go</p><p>You will see the following output:</p><div id="_idContainer291" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B14177_16_01.jpg" alt="Figure 16.1: Race conditions arise when using the pointer here&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.1: Race conditions arise when using the pointer here</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">'GCC' must be installed in order to run this code.</p></li>
				<li>Now, let's run the code without the <strong class="source-inline">race</strong> flag:</li>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.2: Stack trace with racing conditions</p>
			<p>By running the code several times, you can see different results because each routine can change the value of <strong class="source-inline">s1</strong> at any time and in any order, which we cannot know in advance.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you've learned how to use the atomic package to safely modify variables shared by multiple Goroutines. You've learned how direct access to the same variable from different Goroutines can be dangerous and how to use the atomic package to avoid this situation.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-375"><a id="_idTextAnchor420"/>Invisible Concurrency</h1>
			<p>We've seen in the previous exercise, the effects of concurrency through race conditions, but we want to see them in practice. It is easy to understand that concurrency problems are difficult to visualize as they do not manifest in the same way every time we run a program. That's why we are focusing on finding ways to synchronize concurrent work. One easy way to visualize it, however, but that is difficult to use in tests, is to print out each concurrent routine and see the order in which these routines are called. In the previous exercise, for example, we could have sent another parameter with a name and printed the name of the function at each iteration in the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop.</p>
			<p>If we want to see the effects of concurrency and still be able to test it, we could use the atomic package again, this time with strings so that we can build a string containing a message from each Goroutine. For this scenario, we will use the <strong class="source-inline">sync</strong> package again, but we will not make use of the atomic operations. Instead, we will use a new struct called the <strong class="source-inline">mutex</strong>. Mutex is short for "mutual exclusion" and is essentially a way to stop all the routines, run the code in one, and then carry on with the concurrent code. Let's see how we can use it. First of all, it needs the <strong class="source-inline">sync</strong> package to be imported. Then, we create a mutex like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">mtx := sync.Mutex{}</p>
			<p>But most of the time we want to pass a mutex across several functions, so we'd better create a pointer to a mutex:</p>
			<p class="source-code">mtx := &amp;sync.Mutex{}</p>
			<p>This ensures we use the same mutex everywhere. It is important to use the same mutex, but the reason why the mutex has to be only one will be clear after analyzing the methods in the Mutex struct; consider the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">mtx.Lock()</p>
			<p class="source-code">s = s + 5</p>
			<p>The preceding code snippet will lock the execution of all the routines, except the one that will change the variable. At this point, we will add 5 to the current value of <strong class="source-inline">s</strong>. After this, we release the lock using the following command so that any other routine can modify the value of <strong class="source-inline">s</strong>.</p>
			<p class="source-code">mtx.Unlock()</p>
			<p>From now on, any following code will run concurrently. We will see later some better ways to ensure safety when we modify a variable, but, for now, do not worry about adding much code between the lock/unlock part. The more code there is between these constructs, the less concurrent your code will be. So, you should lock the execution of the program, add only the logic required to ensure safety, and unlock and then carry on with the execution of the rest of the code, which does not touch the shared variables.</p>
			<p>One important thing to notice is that the order of asynchronously performed code can change. This is because Goroutines run independently and you cannot know which one runs first. However, each routine runs completely before letting another one run. You should then not rely on Goroutines to order things correctly; you might need to order your results afterward if you need a specific order.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-376"><a id="_idTextAnchor421"/>Activity 16.01: Listing Numbers</h2>
			<p>In this activity, you will need to build a string with all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, instead of using a single loop, you need to split the work across four loops, like in <em class="italic">Exercise 16.03</em>. Moreover, each loop will add the numbers in its own loop. Here are the steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a folder and a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file.</li>
				<li>Create a function that takes a range in its parameters and a string to which you will add all the numbers in its range (also as strings).</li>
				<li>Wrap each number with the character <strong class="source-inline">"|"</strong>, for example, <strong class="source-inline">|4|</strong>, so that the list will have the form <strong class="source-inline">|4||10|</strong>.</li>
				<li>Create the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function where you will create four Goroutines, each one having a range of 25 numbers.</li>
				<li>Make sure all the routines modify the same string safely.</li>
				<li>Make sure the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function will wait for the completion of the routines.</li>
				<li>Print the final string and run the program.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You should be able to complete this activity using everything you've studied so far in this chapter.</p>
			<p>When you run your program, you should see something like this:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-377"><a id="_idTextAnchor422"/>Channels</h1>
			<p>We've seen how to create concurrent code via Goroutines, how to synchronize it with WaitGroup, how to perform atomic operations, and how to temporarily stop the concurrency in order to synchronize access to shared variables. We will now introduce a different concept, the channel, which is typical of Go. A channel is what the name essentially suggests – it's something where messages can be piped, and any routine can send or receive messages through a channel. Similar to a slice, a channel is created the following way:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var ch chan int</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch = make(chan int)</p>
			<p>Of course, it is possible to instantiate the channel directly with the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch := make(chan int)</p>
			<p>Just like with slices, we can also do the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch := make(chan int, 10)</p>
			<p>Here, a channel is created with a buffer of 10 items.</p>
			<p>A channel can be of any type, such as <strong class="source-inline">integer</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Boolean</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">float</strong>, and any <strong class="source-inline">struct</strong> that can be defined, and even slices and pointers, though the last two are generally used less frequently.</p>
			<p>Channels can be passed as parameters to functions, and that's how different Goroutines can share content. Let's see how to send a message to a channel:</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch &lt;- 2</p>
			<p>In this case, we send the value of 2 to the <strong class="source-inline">ch</strong> channel, which is a channel of integers. Of course, trying to send something else than an integer to an integer channel will cause an error.</p>
			<p>After sending a message, we need to be able to receive a message from a channel. To do that, we can just do the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;- ch</p>
			<p>Doing this ensures that the message is received; however, the message is not stored. It might seem useless to lose the message, but we will see that it might actually make sense. Nevertheless, we might want to keep the value received from the channel, and we can do so by storing the value into a new variable:</p>
			<p class="source-code">i := &lt;- ch</p>
			<p>Let's see a simple program that shows us how to use what we've learned so far:</p>
			<p class="source-code">package main</p>
			<p class="source-code">import "log"</p>
			<p class="source-code">func main() {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch := make(chan int,1)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">    i:= &lt;- ch</p>
			<p class="source-code">    log.Println(i)</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>This program essentially creates a new channel, pipes the integer 1 in, then reads it, and finally prints out the value of <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>, which should be 1. This code is not that useful in practice, but with a small change we can see something interesting. Let's make the channel unbuffered by changing the channel definition to the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch := make(chan int)</p>
			<p>If you run the code, you will get the following output:</p>
			<p class="source-code">fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!</p>
			<p class="source-code">goroutine 1 [chan send]:</p>
			<p class="source-code">main.main()</p>
			<p class="source-code">    /Users/deliodanna/goprojects/parallelwork/exercise 4/main.go:8 +0x59</p>
			<p class="source-code">Process finished with exit code 2</p>
			<p>The message may be different depending on the version of Go you are using. Also, some errors like these have been introduced in newer versions. In older versions, though, the compiler was more permissive. In this specific case, the problem is simple: if we do not know how big the channel is, the routines wait indefinitely, and this is called a deadlock. This does not mean we cannot handle unbuffered channels. We will see later how to handle them, as they require more than one routine running. With only one routine, after we send the message, we block the execution and there is no other routine able to receive the message; hence, we have a deadlock.</p>
			<p>Before we go further, let's see one more characteristic of the channels, which is that they can be closed. Channels need to be closed when the task they have been created for is finished. In order to close a channel, type in the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">close(ch)</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you can defer the closing, as shown in the following code snippet:</p>
			<p class="source-code">...</p>
			<p class="source-code">defer close(ch)</p>
			<p class="source-code">for i:=0; i&lt; 100; i++ {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- i</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">return</p>
			<p>In this case, after the <strong class="source-inline">return</strong> statement, the channel is closed as the closing is deferred to run after the <strong class="source-inline">return</strong> statement.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-378"><a id="_idTextAnchor423"/>Exercise 16.04: Exchange Greeting Messages via Channels</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will use a Goroutine to send a greeting message and then we will receive the greeting in the main process. The exercise is very simple and does not need concurrency, but it is a starting point to understand how message passing works.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a folder. In it, create a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file with the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> package:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">    "log"</p><p class="source-code">)</p></li>
				<li>Then, create the <strong class="source-inline">greeter()</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func greet(ch chan string) {</p><p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- "Hello"</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>This function just sends a <strong class="source-inline">Hello</strong> message to a channel and ends.</p></li>
				<li>Now create the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function where you instantiate a channel and pass it to the <strong class="source-inline">greeter</strong>:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    ch := make(chan string)</p><p class="source-code">    go greet(ch)</p><p>Here, only a channel of strings is created and passed as a parameter to the call to a new routine called <strong class="source-inline">greet</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>Now print the result and complete the function:<p class="source-code">log.Println(&lt;-ch)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>Here, we are printing whatever comes from the channel. The following part of the code returns a value, which is passed straight to the <strong class="source-inline">Println</strong> function:</p><p class="source-code">&lt;- ch</p></li>
				<li>Run the program with the following:<p class="source-code">go run main.go</p><p>You will see the following output: </p><p class="source-code">2019/10/28 19:44:11 Hello</p><p>Now we can see that the message has been delivered to the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> function through the channel.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, you have seen how to use channels to make different Goroutines communicate with each other and to synchronize their computations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-379"><a id="_idTextAnchor424"/>Exercise 16.05: Two-Way Message Exchange with Channels</h2>
			<p>What we want now is to send messages from the main routine to the second routine and then get a message back as a response. We will base our code on the previous one and expand it. The main routine will send a <strong class="source-inline">"Hello John"</strong> message, while the second routine will return "<strong class="source-inline">Thanks</strong>" for the message received, stating it in full, and will then add a message: <strong class="source-inline">"Hello David"</strong>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a folder. In it, create a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file with the main package:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">    "fmt"</p><p class="source-code">    "log"</p><p class="source-code">)</p><p>With the necessary imports, we will use the <strong class="source-inline">fmt</strong> package to manipulate the strings.</p></li>
				<li>Write a <strong class="source-inline">greet()</strong> function to return the expected messages:<p class="source-code">func greet(ch chan string) {</p><p class="source-code">    msg := &lt;- ch</p><p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- fmt.Sprintf("Thanks for %s", msg)</p><p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- "Hello David"</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>The <strong class="source-inline">greet() </strong> function signature has not changed. However, now before sending a message, it will first wait for a message and then reply. After receiving the message, this function sends a message back thanking for the greeting, and then sends its own greeting.</p></li>
				<li>Now create the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function and call the <strong class="source-inline">greet()</strong> function as a Goroutine:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    ch := make(chan string)</p><p class="source-code">    go greet(ch)</p><p>Here, the main function is created and a string channel is instantiated. Then, the second Goroutine is started. Next, we need to send the first message from the main routine to the second, which is currently waiting.</p></li>
				<li>Now, to send the message "<strong class="source-inline">Hello John</strong>" to the channel, write the following code:<p class="source-code">ch &lt;- "Hello John"</p></li>
				<li>And finally, add the code that waits for the messages to come back before printing them:<p class="source-code">    log.Println(&lt;-ch)</p><p class="source-code">    log.Println(&lt;-ch)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>You can see that you need to log twice as you expect two messages to come back. In many cases, you will use a loop to retrieve all the messages, which we will see in the next exercise. For now, try to run your code, and you will see something as follows:</p><p class="source-code">2019/10/28 19:44:49 Thanks for Hello John</p><p class="source-code">2019/10/28 19:44:49 Hello David</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>From the output, you can see that both the messages have been received through the channel.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you have learned how a goroutine can both send and receive messages through the same channel and that two goroutines can exchange messages through the same channel in both directions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-380"><a id="_idTextAnchor425"/>Exercise 16.06: Sum Numbers from Everywhere</h2>
			<p>Imagine you want to add a few numbers but the numbers come from several sources. They might come from a feed or from a database; we just do not know which numbers we are going to add and where they come from. However, we need to add them all in one place. In this exercise, we will have four Goroutines sending numbers in particular ranges, and the main routine, which will calculate their sum. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Let's start by creating a new folder and the main file. After you've done that, write the package and imports:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">    "log"</p><p class="source-code">    "time"</p><p class="source-code">)</p><p>Here, we also include the <strong class="source-inline">time</strong> package, which we will use to do a small trick that will help us to better visualize the effects of concurrency.</p></li>
				<li>Now write the <strong class="source-inline">push</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func push(from,to int, out chan int) {</p><p class="source-code">    for i:=from;i&lt;=to; i++ {</p><p class="source-code">        out &lt;- i</p><p class="source-code">        time.Sleep(time.Microsecond)</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>This sends all the numbers in the <strong class="source-inline">from, to</strong> range to the channel. After each message is sent, the routine sleeps for a microsecond so that another routine will pick up the work.</p></li>
				<li>Now write the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    s1 := 0</p><p class="source-code">    ch := make(chan int, 100)</p><p>This code creates a variable for the final sum, <strong class="source-inline">s1</strong>, and one for the channel, <strong class="source-inline">ch</strong>, which has a buffer of 100.</p></li>
				<li>Now create the four <strong class="source-inline">go</strong> routines:<p class="source-code">    go push(1,25, ch)</p><p class="source-code">    go push(26,50,ch)</p><p class="source-code">    go push(51,75,ch)</p><p class="source-code">    go push(76,100, ch)</p></li>
				<li>At this point, we need to gather all the numbers to add, so we create a loop of 100 cycles:<p class="source-code">    for c :=0; c&lt; 100; c++ {</p></li>
				<li>Then read the number from the channel like this:<p class="source-code">        i := &lt;- ch</p></li>
				<li>We also want to see which number came from which Goroutine:<p class="source-code">        log.Println(i)</p></li>
				<li>Finally, we calculate the sum and show the result:<p class="source-code">        s1 += i</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p class="source-code">    log.Println(s1)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>Here, we have the truncated output once you run the program:</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 76</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 26</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 51</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 77</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 52</p><p class="source-code">……………………………………………………………</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 48</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 75</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 100</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 23</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 49</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 24</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 50</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 25</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 21:42:09 5050</p><p>Here, based on the results, we can easily guess which number comes from which routine. The last line displays the sum of all numbers. If you run your program multiple times, you will see that the order of the numbers changes as well.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we saw how we can split some computational work across several concurrent routines and then gather all the computation in a single routine. Each routine performs a task. In this case, one sends numbers, while another receives the numbers and performs a sum.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-381"><a id="_idTextAnchor426"/>Exercise 16.07: Request to Goroutines</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will solve the same problem mentioned in <em class="italic">Exercise 16.06</em>, <em class="italic">Sum Numbers from Everywhere</em>, but in a different way. Instead of receiving numbers as the routines send them, we will make the main routine ask for the numbers from the other routines. We will play with channel operations and experiment with their blocking nature.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a folder and a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file with the main package. Then, add the following import:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">    "log"</p><p class="source-code">)</p></li>
				<li>Then write the signature of the <strong class="source-inline">push</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func push(from,to int, in chan bool, out chan int) {</p><p>Here, there are two channels, a Boolean one called <strong class="source-inline">in</strong>, which represents the incoming requests, and <strong class="source-inline">out</strong>, which will be used to send back messages.</p></li>
				<li>Now write a loop for sending numbers when a request comes in:<p class="source-code">    for i:=from;i&lt;=to; i++ {</p><p class="source-code">        &lt;- in</p><p class="source-code">        out &lt;- i</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>As you can see, the loop is still for a fixed number of items. Before sending anything, it waits for a request from the <strong class="source-inline">in</strong> channel. When it receives a request, it sends a number.</p></li>
				<li>Now create the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function, where you call the <strong class="source-inline">push</strong> function in four different goroutines, each one sending a subset of the numbers 1 to 100:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    s1 := 0</p><p class="source-code">    out := make(chan int, 100)</p><p class="source-code">    in := make(chan bool,100)</p><p class="source-code">    go push(1,25, in, out)</p><p class="source-code">    go push(26,50,in, out)</p><p class="source-code">    go push(51,75,in, out)</p><p class="source-code">    go push(76,100, in, out)</p><p>This is pretty similar to the previous exercise, but it creates the extra channel, <strong class="source-inline">in</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>Now create a loop to request a number, print it, and add it to the total:<p class="source-code">    for c :=0; c&lt; 100; c++ {</p><p class="source-code">        in &lt;- true</p><p class="source-code">        i := &lt;- out</p><p class="source-code">        log.Println(i)</p><p class="source-code">        s1 += i</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p class="source-code">    log.Println(s1)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>In this case, the loop first requests a number, then waits to receive another number. Here, we do not need to sleep for a microsecond because after we receive a number, the next request will go to any active Goroutine. If you run the program, you will again see something similar to what you saw in the previous exercise. Here, we have the truncated output:</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 76</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 1</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 77</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 26</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 51</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 2</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 78</p><p class="source-code">…………………………………………………………</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 74</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 25</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 50</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 75</p><p class="source-code">2019/07/08 22:18:00 5050</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can see that each number is printed in the order it is received. Then, the sum of all numbers is printed on the screen.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you've learned how you can use channels to request other goroutines to perform some actions. A channel can be used to send some trigger messages and not only to exchange content and values.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-382"><a id="_idTextAnchor427"/>The Importance of Concurrency</h1>
			<p>So far, we've seen how to use concurrency to split the work over several Goroutines, but in all these exercises concurrency was not really needed. In fact, you do not save much time doing what we did, nor do you have any other advantage. Concurrency is important when you need to perform several tasks that are logically independent from each other, and the easiest case to understand is a web server. You saw in <em class="italic">Chapter 15,</em> <em class="italic">HTTP Servers</em>, that several clients will most likely connect to the same server and all these connections will result in the server performing some actions. Also, these actions are all independent; that's where concurrency is important, as you do not want one of your users to have to wait for all the other HTTP requests to be completed before their request gets handled. Another case for concurrency is when you have different data sources to gather data and you can actually gather that data in different routines and combine the result at the end. We will see now some more complex applications for concurrency and learn how to use it for HTTP servers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-383"><a id="_idTextAnchor428"/>Exercise 16.08: Equally Splitting the Work between Routines</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will see how we can perform our sum of numbers in a predefined number of routines for them to gather the result at the end. Essentially, we want to create a function that adds numbers and receives the numbers from a channel. When no more numbers are received by the function, we will send the sum to the main function through the channel.</p>
			<p>One thing to note here is that the function performing the sum does not know in advance how many numbers it will receive, which means we cannot have a fixed <strong class="source-inline">from, to</strong> range. So, we have to find another solution. We need to be able to split the work in any number of Goroutines and not be bound by a <strong class="source-inline">from, to</strong> range. Also, we do not want to do the addition in the main function. Instead, we want to create a function that will split the work over several routines.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a folder and a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file with the main package and write the following:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">    "log"</p><p class="source-code">)</p></li>
				<li>Now let's write the function to do a partial addition. We will call it <strong class="source-inline">worker()</strong> as we will have a fixed set of routines running this same function, waiting for numbers to arrive:<p class="source-code">func worker(in chan int, out chan int) {</p><p class="source-code">sum := 0</p><p class="source-code">    for i := range in {</p><p class="source-code">        sum += i</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p class="source-code">    out &lt;- sum</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>As you can see, we have an <strong class="source-inline">in</strong> channel and an <strong class="source-inline">out</strong> channel of integers. Then, we instantiate the <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> variable, which will store the sum of all the numbers sent to this worker.</p></li>
				<li>At this point, we have a loop that ranges over the channel. This is interesting because we do not use <strong class="source-inline">in</strong> directly as follows:<p class="source-code">&lt;- in</p><p>We, instead, rely only on the range to get the numbers in. In the loop, we just add <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> to the total and, at the end, we send the partial sum back. Even if we do not know how many items are going to be sent to the channel, we can still loop over the range without a problem. We rely on the fact that when no more items are sent, the <strong class="source-inline">in</strong> channel will be closed.</p></li>
				<li>Now create the <strong class="source-inline">sum()</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func sum(workers, from, to int) int {</p><p>This is the actual <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> function that has the number of workers and the usual range for the numbers to add. </p></li>
				<li>Now write a loop to run the requested number of workers:<p class="source-code">    out := make(chan int, workers)</p><p class="source-code">    in := make(chan int,4)</p><p class="source-code">    for i:=0;i&lt;workers;i++ {</p><p class="source-code">        go worker(in, out)</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p>This creates the two <strong class="source-inline">in</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">out</strong> channels and runs the number of workers set by the <strong class="source-inline">workers</strong> parameter.</p></li>
				<li>Then create a loop to send all the numbers to the <strong class="source-inline">in</strong> channel:<p class="source-code">    for i:=from;i&lt;=to; i++ {</p><p class="source-code">        in &lt;- i</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p>This sends all the numbers to be summed to the channel, which will distribute the numbers across all the routines. If you were to print out the numbers received across with the index of the worker, you could see how the numbers are distributed uniformly across the routines, which does not mean an exact split, but at least it's a fair one.</p></li>
				<li>As we sent all the numbers, we now need to receive the partial sums back, but before that we need to notify the function that the numbers to sum are finished, so add the following:<p class="source-code">    close(in)</p><p class="source-code">    </p></li>
				<li>And then perform the sum of the partials:<p class="source-code">    sum := 0</p><p class="source-code">    for i:=0;i&lt;workers; i++ {</p><p class="source-code">        sum += &lt;-out</p><p class="source-code">    }</p></li>
				<li>Then, finally, close the <strong class="source-inline">out</strong> channel and return the result:<p class="source-code">    close(out)</p><p class="source-code">    return sum</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>At this point, we need to somehow execute this function. So, let's write a simple main function to do that:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    res := sum(100,1,100)</p><p class="source-code">    log.Println(res)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>This simply outputs a sum from a function that makes use of concurrency, and then prints out the result.</p></li>
				<li>If you run your program, you should see the log output of the sum of numbers split into different routines as follows:<p class="source-code">2019/10/28 19:49:13 5050</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you can see, after splitting the computation across multiple goroutines, the result is synchronized into one single result.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you've learned how to make use of concurrency to split your computation across several concurrent goroutines and then combine all these computations into one single result.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-384"><a id="_idTextAnchor429"/>Concurrency Patterns</h1>
			<p>The way we organize our concurrent work is pretty much the same in every application. We will look at one common pattern that is called a <em class="italic">pipeline</em>, where we have a source, and then messages are sent from one routine to another until the end of the line, until all the routines in the pipeline have been utilized. Another pattern is the <em class="italic">fan out</em>/ <em class="italic">fan in</em> pattern where, as in the previous exercise, the work is sent to several routines reading from the same channel. All these patterns, however, are generally made of a <em class="italic">source</em> stage, which is the first stage of the pipeline and the one that gathers, or sources, the data, then some internal steps, and at the end a <em class="italic">sink</em>, which is the final stage where the results of the process from all the other routines get merged. It is known as a sink because all the data sinks into it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-385">Acti<a id="_idTextAnchor430"/>vity 16.02: Source Files</h2>
			<p>In this activity, you will create a program that will read two files at the same time containing some numbers. You will need to pipe those numbers to a function that will split them into even and odd based on their values. It will then send the odd numbers to one routine, even numbers to another. It will then write the addition of all the even and odd numbers to another file.</p>
			<p>You will need two files with numbers that you will use as the sources. Then, you will produce one file with the sum of all the odd numbers in one row and then the sum of all the even numbers in the row below. The high-level steps for this activity are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create two input files. You could use more, but the suggested code will use two.</li>
				<li>Add some numbers in your input files, one number per line and nothing else. You need an empty line at the end of each file.</li>
				<li>Create your main program and start with your imports.</li>
				<li>Create a function to read a file and pipe each line to a channel. Be careful here, though; you may need to add a WaitGroup or something else to avoid any deadlocks.</li>
				<li>Create a function to receive the numbers and pipe the odd numbers to one channel and the even numbers to another channel.</li>
				<li>Create a function to sum the numbers and pipe the result to a new channel.</li>
				<li>Create a merging function to read from the odd and even channels and write to a file called <strong class="source-inline">result.txt</strong>. Each line in this file should contain the word "Odd" or "Even," depending on the value, followed by the sum.</li>
				<li>Create the main function to run all the Goroutines and handle the WaitGroups, if needed.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you run your program, you should see nothing in the console, but a file called <strong class="source-inline">result.txt</strong> should have been created. Depending on the numbers in your input files, you will find that the content of the output file is something similar to the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Odd 9</p>
			<p class="source-code">Eve<a id="_idTextAnchor431"/>n 12</p>

			<p class="callout">The solution for this activity can be found on page 768.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-386"><a id="_idTextAnchor432"/>Buffers</h1>
			<p>You've seen in the previous exercises that there are channels with a defined length and channels with an undetermined length:</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch1 := make(chan int)</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch2 := make(chan int, 10)</p>
			<p>Let's see how we can make use of this.</p>
			<p>A buffer is like a container that needs to be filled with some content, so you prepare it when you expect to receive that content. We said that operations on channels are blocking operations, which means the execution of the routine will stop and wait whenever you try to read a message from the channel. Let's try to understand what this means in practice with an example. Let's say we have the following code in a Goroutine:</p>
			<p class="source-code">i := &lt;- ch</p>
			<p>We know that before we can carry on with the execution of the code, we need to receive a message. However, there is something more about this blocking behavior. If the channel does not have a buffer, the Goroutine is blocked as well. It is not possible to write to a channel, nor to receive a channel. We'll get a better idea of this with an example, and we will show how to use unbuffered channels to achieve the same result, so you will get a better understanding of what you've seen in the previous exercises.</p>
			<p>Let's have a look at this code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch := make(chan int, 2)</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch &lt;- 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch &lt;- 2</p>
			<p class="source-code">fmt.Println(&lt;-ch)</p>
			<p class="source-code">fmt.Println(&lt;-ch)</p>
			<p>If you put this code inside a function, you will see that it works perfectly and will display something as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">1</p>
			<p class="source-code">2</p>
			<p>But what if you add an extra read? Let's take a look:</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch := make(chan int, 2)</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch &lt;- 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch &lt;- 2</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch &lt;- 3</p>
			<p class="source-code">fmt.Println(&lt;-ch)</p>
			<p class="source-code">fmt.Println(←ch)</p>
			<p>In this case, you will see an error:</p>
			<p class="source-code">fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!</p>
			<p class="source-code">goroutine 1 [chan send]:</p>
			<p class="source-code">main.main()</p>
			<p class="source-code">    /tmp/sandbox223984687/prog.go:9 +0xa0</p>
			<p>This happens because the routine running this code is blocked after the buffer of size 2 is filled with a data size of 2 coming from the read operations (commonly referred to as reads), which result in the buffer being filled with data, which, in this case, has 2 data and the buffer has a size of 2. We can increase the buffer:</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch := make(chan int, 3)</p>
			<p>And it will work again; we are just not displaying the third number.</p>
			<p>Now, let's see what happens if we remove the buffer. Try, and again you will see the previous error. This happens because the buffer is always full and the routine is blocked. An unbuffered channel is equivalent to the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch := make(chan int, 0)</p>
			<p>We've used unbuffered channels without any issues. Let's see an example of how to use them:</p>
			<p class="source-code">package main</p>
			<p class="source-code">import "fmt"</p>
			<p class="source-code">func readThem(ch chan int) {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  for {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(&lt;- ch)</p>
			<p class="source-code">  }</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">func main() {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch := make(chan int)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    go readThem(ch)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- 2</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- 3</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>If you run this program, you should see something as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">1</p>
			<p class="source-code">2</p>
			<p class="source-code">3</p>
			<p>But there is a chance you could see fewer numbers. If you run this on the Go Playground, you should see this result, but if you run it in your machine, you might see fewer numbers. Try sending more numbers:</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch &lt;- 4</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch &lt;- 5</p>
			<p>At each addition, run your program; you might not see all the numbers. Basically, there are two routines: one is reading messages from an unbuffered channel, and the main routine is sending these messages through the same channel. Due to this, there is no deadlock. This shows that we can make use of unbuffered channels for read and write operations flawlessly by using two routines. We still have, however, an issue with not all numbers showing up, which we can fix in the following way:</p>
			<p class="source-code">package main</p>
			<p class="source-code">import "fmt"</p>
			<p class="source-code">import "sync"</p>
			<p class="source-code">func readThem(ch chan int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  for i := range ch {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(i)</p>
			<p class="source-code">  }</p>
			<p class="source-code">  wg.Done()</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">func main() {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    wg := &amp;sync.WaitGroup{}</p>
			<p class="source-code">    wg.Add(1)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch := make(chan int)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    go readThem(ch, wg)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- 2</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- 3</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- 4</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch &lt;- 5</p>
			<p class="source-code">    close(ch)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    wg.Wait()</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>Here, we iterate over the channel inside the Goroutine, and we stop as soon as the channel gets closed. This is because when the channel gets closed, the range stops iterating. The channel gets closed in the main routine after everything is sent. We make use of a WaitGroup here to know that everything is completed. If we were not closing the channel in the main function, we would be in the main routine, which will terminate before the second routine would print all the numbers. There is another way, however, to wait for the execution of the second routine to be completed, and this is with explicit notification, which we will see in the next exercise. One thing to notice is that even though we close the channel, the messages still all arrive at the receiving routine. This is because the channel is closed only after all the messages are received by the receiver.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-387"><a id="_idTextAnchor433"/>Exercise 16.09: Notifying When Computation Has Finished</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we want to have one routine to send messages and another one to print them. Moreover, we want to know when the sender has finished sending the messages. The code will be similar to the previous example, with some modifications.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new file and import the necessary packages:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import "log"</p></li>
				<li>Then define the function that will first receive the strings and print them later:<p class="source-code">func readThem(in, out chan string) {</p></li>
				<li>Then create the loop over the channel until the channel is closed:<p class="source-code">    for i := range in {</p><p class="source-code">        log.Println(i)</p><p class="source-code">    }</p></li>
				<li>And finally, send the notification saying that the processing has finished:<p class="source-code">    out &lt;- "done"</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>Now, let's build the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    log.SetFlags(0)</p><p>Here, we've also set the <strong class="source-inline">log</strong> flags to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> so we do not see anything other than the strings we send.</p></li>
				<li>Now, create the necessary channels and use them to spin up the Goroutine:<p class="source-code">    in, out  := make(chan string), make(chan string)</p><p class="source-code">    go readThem(in, out)</p></li>
				<li>Next, create a set of strings and loop over them, sending each string to the channel:<p class="source-code">    strs := []string{"a","b", "c", "d", "e", "f"}</p><p class="source-code">    for _, s := range strs {</p><p class="source-code">        in &lt;- s</p><p class="source-code">    }</p></li>
				<li>After that, close the channel you used to send the messages and wait for the done signal:<p class="source-code">    close(in)</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;-out</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>If you run your program, you will see the log output of code using a <strong class="source-inline">done</strong> channel:</p><p class="source-code">a</p><p class="source-code">b</p><p class="source-code">c</p><p class="source-code">d</p><p class="source-code">e</p><p class="source-code">f</p><p>We see that the main function has received all the messages from the Goroutine and has printed them. The main function terminates only when it has been notified that all the incoming messages have been sent.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, you've learned how you can make a Goroutine notify another Goroutine that the work has finished by passing a message through a channel without needing WaitGroup.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-388"><a id="_idTextAnchor434"/>Some More Common Practices</h2>
			<p>In all these examples, we've created channels and passed them through, but functions can also return channels and can also spin up new routines. Here is an example:</p>
			<p class="source-code">func doSomething() chan int {</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ch := make(chan int)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    go func() {</p>
			<p class="source-code">        for i := range ch {</p>
			<p class="source-code">            log.Println(i)</p>
			<p class="source-code">        }</p>
			<p class="source-code">    }()</p>
			<p class="source-code">    return ch</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>In this case, we can actually have the following in our <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function:</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch := doSomething()</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch &lt;- 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">ch &lt;- 4</p>
			<p>We do not need to call the <strong class="source-inline">doSomething</strong> function as a Goroutine because it will actually spin up a new one by itself.</p>
			<p>Some functions can also return or accept:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;- chan int</p>
			<p>Or:</p>
			<p class="source-code">chan &lt;- int</p>
			<p>This makes clear what the function does with the channels. In fact, you could try to specify the direction in all the exercises we've done so far and see what happens if you specify an incorrect one.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-389"><a id="_idTextAnchor435"/>HTTP Servers</h1>
			<p>You've seen how to build HTTP servers in <em class="italic">Chapter 15, HTTP Servers</em>, but you might remember that there was something that's difficult to handle with HTTP servers, and this was the application's state. Essentially, an HTTP server runs as a single program and listens to requests in the main routine. However, when a new HTTP request is made by one of the clients, a new routine is created that handles that specific request. You have not done it manually, nor have you managed the server's channels, but this is how it works internally. You do not actually need to send anything across the different Goroutines because each routine and each request is independent since they have been made by different people. </p>
			<p>However, what you must think of is how to not create race conditions when you want to keep a state. Most HTTP servers are stateless, especially if you're building a microservice environment. However, you might want to keep track of things with a counter, or you might actually work with TCP servers or a gaming server or a chat app where you need to keep the state and gather information from all the peers. The techniques you've learned in this chapter allow you to do so. You can use a mutex to make sure a counter is thread-safe, or better, routine-safe, across all the requests. I'd suggest you go back to your code for the HTTP server and ensure safety with mutexes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-390"><a id="_idTextAnchor436"/>Methods as Routines</h1>
			<p>So far, you've only seen functions used as Goroutines, but methods are simple functions with a receiver; hence, they can be used asynchronously too. This can be useful if you want to share some properties of your struct, such as for your counter in an HTTP server.</p>
			<p>With this technique, you can encapsulate the channels you use across several routines belonging to the same instance of a struct without having to pass these channels everywhere.</p>
			<p>Here is a simple example of how to do that:</p>
			<p class="source-code">type MyStruct struct {}</p>
			<p class="source-code">func (m MyStruct) doIt()</p>
			<p class="source-code">. . . . . . </p>
			<p class="source-code">ms := MyStruct{}</p>
			<p class="source-code">go ms.doIt()</p>
			<p>But let's see how to apply this in an exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-391"><a id="_idTextAnchor437"/>Exercise 16.10: A Structured Work</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will calculate a sum using several workers. A worker is essentially a function, and we will be organizing these workers into a single struct.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create your folder and <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> file. In it, add the required imports and define a <strong class="source-inline">Worker</strong> struct with two channels – <strong class="source-inline">in</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">out</strong>. Ensure that you add a mutex as well:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">    "fmt"</p><p class="source-code">    "sync"</p><p class="source-code">)</p><p class="source-code">type Worker struct {</p><p class="source-code">    in, out chan int</p><p class="source-code">    sbw int</p><p class="source-code">    mtx *sync.Mutex</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>To create its methods, write the following:<p class="source-code">func (w *Worker) readThem() {</p><p class="source-code">    w.sbw++</p><p class="source-code">    go func() {</p><p>Here, we create a method and increment the number of <strong class="source-inline">subworkers</strong>. Sub-workers are basically identical routines that split the work that needs to be done. Note that the function is meant to be used directly and not as a Goroutine, as it itself creates a new Goroutine.</p></li>
				<li>Now, build the content of the spawned routine:<p class="source-code">        partial := 0</p><p class="source-code">        for i := range w.in {</p><p class="source-code">            partial += i</p><p class="source-code">        }</p><p class="source-code">        w.out &lt;- partial</p></li>
				<li>This is pretty similar to what you've done before; now comes the tricky part:<p class="source-code">        w.mtx.Lock()</p><p class="source-code">        w.sbw--</p><p class="source-code">        if w.sbw == 0 {</p><p class="source-code">            close(w.out)</p><p class="source-code">        }</p><p class="source-code">        w.mtx.Unlock()</p><p class="source-code">    }()</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>Here, we've locked the routine, reduced the counter on the sub-workers safely, and then, in case all the workers have terminated, we've closed the output channel. Then we've unlocked the execution to allow the program to carry on.</p></li>
				<li>At this point, we need to make a function that's able to return the sum:<p class="source-code">func (w *Worker) gatherResult() int {</p><p class="source-code">    total := 0</p><p class="source-code">    wg := &amp;sync.WaitGroup{}</p><p class="source-code">    wg.Add(1)</p><p class="source-code">    go func() {</p></li>
				<li>Here, we create a total, then a Waitgroup, and we add 1 to it as we will spawn only one routine whose content is as follows:<p class="source-code">        for  i:= range w.out{</p><p class="source-code">            total += i</p><p class="source-code">        }</p><p class="source-code">        wg.Done()</p><p class="source-code">    }()</p><p>As you can see, we have looped until the out channel is closed by one of the sub-workers. </p></li>
				<li>At this point, we can wait for the routine to finish and return the result:<p class="source-code">    wg.Wait()</p><p class="source-code">    return total</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>The main code just sets up the variables for the worker and its sub-workers:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    mtx := &amp;sync.Mutex{}</p><p class="source-code">    in := make(chan int, 100)</p><p class="source-code">    wrNum := 10</p><p class="source-code">    out := make(chan int)</p><p class="source-code">    wrk := Worker{in: in, out:out, mtx:mtx}</p></li>
				<li>Now create a loop where you call the <strong class="source-inline">readThem()</strong> method <strong class="source-inline">wrNum</strong> times. This will create some sub-workers:<p class="source-code">    for i:=1; i&lt;=wrNum; i++ {</p><p class="source-code">        wrk.readThem()</p><p class="source-code">    }</p></li>
				<li>Now send the numbers to be summed to the channel:<p class="source-code">    for i:=1;i&lt;=100; i++ {</p><p class="source-code">        in &lt;- i</p><p class="source-code">    }</p></li>
				<li>Close the channel to notify that all the numbers have been sent:<p class="source-code">    close(in)</p></li>
				<li>Then wait for the result and print it out:<p class="source-code">    res := wrk.gatherResult()</p><p class="source-code">    fmt.Println(res)</p><p class="source-code">}</p></li>
				<li>If you run the program, you will see the log output of a sum made using structs to organize our work:<p class="source-code">5050</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, you've learned how to use a method of a struct to create a new Goroutine. The method can just be called like any function, but the result will be a new anonymous goroutine being created.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-392"><a id="_idTextAnchor438"/>Go Context Package</h1>
			<p>We've seen how to run concurrent code and run it until it has finished, waiting for the completion of some processing through WaitGroup or channel reads. You might have seen in some Go code, especially code related to HTTP calls, some parameters from the <strong class="source-inline">context</strong> package, and you might have wondered what it is and why it is used. All the code we've written here is running in our machines and does not pass through the internet, so we hardly have any delay due to latency; however, in situations involving HTTP calls, we might encounter servers that do not respond and get stuck. In such cases, how do we stop our call if the server does not respond after a while? How do we stop the execution of a routine that runs independently when an event occurs? Well, we have several ways, but a standard one is to use contexts, and we will see now how they work. A context is a variable that is passed through a series of calls and might hold some values or may be empty. It is a container, but it is not used in order to send values across functions; you can use normal integers, strings, and so on for this purpose. A <strong class="source-inline">context</strong> is passed through in order to get back control of what is happening:</p>
			<p class="source-code">func doIt(c context.Context , a int, b string) {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  fmt.Println(b)</p>
			<p class="source-code">  doThat(c, a*2)</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">func doThat(c context.Context , a int) {</p>
			<p class="source-code">  fmt.Println(a)</p>
			<p class="source-code">  doMore(c)</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>As you can see, there are several calls, and <strong class="source-inline">c</strong> is passed through but we do not do anything with it. However, it can contain data, and it contains functions that we can use in order to stop the execution of the current routine. We will see how it works in the next exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-393"><a id="_idTextAnchor439"/>Exercise 16.11: Managing Routines with Context</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will start a Goroutine with an infinite loop counting from zero until we decide to stop it. We will make use of the context to notify the routine to stop and a sleeping function to make sure we know how many iterations we do.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create your folder and a <strong class="source-inline">main.go</strong> file, then write the following:<p class="source-code">package main</p><p class="source-code">import (</p><p class="source-code">    "context"</p><p class="source-code">    "log"</p><p class="source-code">    "time"</p><p class="source-code">)</p><p>For the usual imports, we have <strong class="source-inline">logs</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">time</strong>, which we've already seen, plus the <strong class="source-inline">context</strong> package.</p></li>
				<li>Let's write a function that counts every 100 milliseconds from 0:<p class="source-code">func countNumbers(c context.Context, r chan int) {</p><p class="source-code">    v := 0</p><p class="source-code">    for {</p><p>Here, <strong class="source-inline">v</strong> is the value we count from zero. The <strong class="source-inline">c</strong> variable is the context, while the <strong class="source-inline">r</strong> variable is the channel returning the result. Then, we start defining the loop.</p></li>
				<li>Now, we start an infinite loop, but inside it we will have <strong class="source-inline">select</strong>:<p class="source-code">         select {</p><p class="source-code">        case &lt;-c.Done():</p><p class="source-code">            r &lt;- v</p><p class="source-code">            break</p><p>In this <strong class="source-inline">select</strong> group, we have a case where we check whether the context is <strong class="source-inline">done</strong>, and if it is, we just break the loop and return the value we have counted so far.</p></li>
				<li>If the context is not <strong class="source-inline">done</strong>, we need to keep counting:<p class="source-code">            default:</p><p class="source-code">            time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 100)</p><p class="source-code">            v++</p><p class="source-code">        }</p><p class="source-code">    }</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>Here, we sleep for 100 milliseconds and then we increment the value by 1.</p></li>
				<li>The next step is to write a <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function that makes use of this counter:<p class="source-code">func main() {</p><p class="source-code">    r := make(chan int)</p><p class="source-code">    c := context.TODO()</p><p>We create an integer channel to pass to the counter and a <strong class="source-inline">context</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>We need to be able to cancel the context, so we extend this simple context with a cancellable context:<p class="source-code">     cl, stop := context.WithCancel(c)</p><p class="source-code">    go countNumbers(cl, r)</p><p>Here, we also finally call the counting routine.</p></li>
				<li>At this point, we need a way to break the loop, so we will use the <strong class="source-inline">stop()</strong> function returned by <strong class="source-inline">context.WithCancel</strong>, but we will do that inside another Goroutine. This will stop the context after 300 milliseconds:<p class="source-code">     go func() {</p><p class="source-code">        time.Sleep(time.Millisecond*100*3)</p><p class="source-code">        stop()</p><p class="source-code">    }()</p></li>
				<li>And at this point, we just need to wait for the message with the count to be received and log it:<p class="source-code">     v := &lt;- r</p><p class="source-code">    log.Println(v)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>After 300 milliseconds have passed, the counter will return 3 since, due to context manipulation, the routine stopped at the third iteration:</p><p class="source-code">2019/10/28 20:00:58 3</p><p>Here, we can see that even though the loop is infinite, the execution stops after three iterations.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, you've learned how you can use the context to stop the execution of a routine. This is very useful in many cases, such as when performing long tasks that you want to stop after a maximum amount of time.</p>
			<p>One thing to mention is that, in this exercise, we did something that in some situations could lead to problems. What we did was create a channel in one Goroutine, but close it in another one. This is not wrong; in some cases, it might be useful, but try to avoid it as it could lead to problems when somebody looks at the code, or when you look at the code after several months, because it is difficult to track where a channel is closed across several functions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-394"><a id="_idTextAnchor440"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you've learned how to create production-ready concurrent code, how to handle race conditions, and how to make sure that your code is concurrent-safe. You've learned how to use channels to make your goroutines communicate with each other and how to stop their executions using the context.</p>
			<p>You've worked on several techniques to handle concurrent computation. In many real-life scenarios, you might just use functions and methods that handle concurrency for you, especially if you're doing web programming, but there are cases where you have to handle the work coming from some different sources by yourself. You need to match requests with your response through different channels. You might need to gather different data into one single routine from different ones. With what you've learned here, you'll be able to do all that. You'll be able to ensure you do not lose data by waiting for all the Goroutines to finish. You'll be able to modify the same variable from different routines, making sure you do not override a value if it is not what you want. You've also learned how to avoid deadlocks and how to use channels in order to share information. One of the Go mottos is "share by communicating, do not communicate by sharing." This means that the preferred way to share values is to send them via a channel and not rely on mutexes if not strictly necessary. You now know how to do all that.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will learn to make your code more professional. Essentially, you will learn what you are expected to do as a professional in a real working environment, which is testing and checking your code, making sure, essentially, that your code works and is valid.</p>
