- en: In the highly interconnected world of microservices, gRPC has become an important
    communication technology. By standing on the shoulders of Protobuf and implementing
    must-have features during communication, gRPC provides reliable, efficient, and
    user-friendly APIs. In this book, you will explore why this is the case, how to
    write these APIs, and how to use them in production. The overall goal is to get
    you to understand how to use gRPC but also how gRPC works. First, you will get
    an introduction to the networking and Protobuf concepts you need to know before
    using gRPC. Then, you will see how to write unary and different stream APIs. And
    finally, in the rest of the book, you will learn about gRPC’s features and how
    to create production-grade APIs.
