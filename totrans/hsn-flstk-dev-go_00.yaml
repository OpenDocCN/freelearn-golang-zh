- en: The Go programming language has been rapidly adopted by developers for building
    web applications. With its impressive performance and ease of development, Go
    enjoys the support of a wide variety of open source frameworks for building scalable
    and high-performance web services and applications. This book is a comprehensive
    guide that covers all aspects of full stack development with Go. As you progress
    through the book, you'll gradually build an online musical instrument store application
    from scratch.

- en: This clearly written, example-rich book begins with a practical exposure to
    Go development, by covering Go's building blocks, as well as Go's powerful concurrency
    features. We'll then explore the popular React framework, and work on building
    the frontend of our application with it. From there, you will build RESTful Web
    APIs utilizing the Gin framework, which is a very powerful and popular Go framework
    for Web APIs. After that, we will dive deeper into important software backend
    concepts, such as connecting to the database using an **object-relational mapping**
    (**ORM**), designing routes for your services, securing your services, and even
    charging credit cards using the popular Stripe API. We will also cover how to
    test and benchmark your applications efficiently in a production environment.
    In the concluding chapters, we will cover isomorphic development in pure Go by
    learning about GopherJS.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will appeal to developers who are planning to start building functional
    full stack web applications in Go. Basic knowledge of the Go language and JavaScript
    is expected. Some knowledge of HTML and CSS is also expected. The book targets
    web developers who are looking to move to the Go language.

    Go*, provides an introduction to the topics covered in the book, as well as an
    overview of the architecture of the application that will be built throughout
    the book. This chapter also provides us with a glimpse of what to expect from

    the Go Language*, introduces us to the building blocks of the Go language, and
    how to utilize them to build simple applications. It starts by covering Go''s
    syntax for variables, conditional statements, loops, and functions. From there,
    it covers how to construct data structures in Go, and how to attach methods to
    them. It then concludes by focusing on learning how to write interfaces that can
    describe the behaviors of our program.'

    covers the concurrency features of the Go language. It covers Go''s concurrency
    primitives, such as goroutines, channels, and select statements, and then moves
    to cover some important concepts for productive concurrent software, such as locks,
    and wait groups.'

    covers the building blocks of the extremely popular React.js framework. It starts
    by taking a look at React components, which are the foundation for the React framework.
    From there, it covers props for passing data to components. And finally, it describes
    handling state and using developer tools.'

    chapter. It builds the React components needed for the GoMusic store, and makes
    use of React''s developer tools to troubleshoot the frontend. The majority of
    the frontend code will be covered in this chapter.'

    and our backend Web APIs. It covers important practical topics such as how to
    extend functionality by using middleware, how to achieve user authentication,
    how to attach logs, and how to add validations to our model bindings. It also
    covers the concept of ORMs, and how to connect our Web API backend to a MySQL
    database through a Go ORM. At the end, it will cover some of the remaining React
    code, then we will discuss how to connect the React app to our Go backend. The
    chapter also covers how to build and deploy a React application to production.'

    help us to learn about the types and methods that can be used with the testing
    package to create unit tests that can be integrated with the code. It will then
    focus on learning how to benchmark our code to inspect its performance.'

    that helps to transpile Go''s code into JavaScript, which in effect allows us
    to write frontend code in Go. If you are looking to write your frontend in Go
    instead of JavaScript, GopherJS is the way to do it. This chapter will discuss
    the basics of GopherJS, then cover some examples and use cases. We will also discuss
    how to combine GopherJS with React.js, by building a simple React application
    in GopherJS.'
