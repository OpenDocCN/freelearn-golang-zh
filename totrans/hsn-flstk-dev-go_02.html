<p>This book is the result of an effort to provide you, the reader, with a very practical and concise learning tool for building full stack web applications in Go. Learning how to build full stack web applications in a powerful language such as Go can be a very valuable skill, as it allows you to write fully functional and scalable applications on your own. Go is known in the <span>industry</span> for both its performance and relative ease of use. This ensures that your applications can sustain growing data loads and expanding users, without suffering from scalability issues too early.</p>
<p>Full stack developers are the main drivers behind software startups; this is because of their ability to build products both quickly and efficiently from scratch. They are also typically the key members or the <strong>subject-matter experts</strong> (<strong>SMEs</strong>) in large corporations, as they help architect software systems, from the user interface down to the backend code. Even as an individual developer, learning full stack web programming can help you build your product ideas quickly, over a weekend or two.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is full stack development?</li>
<li>What will we build?</li>
<li>The outline of this book</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we take any further steps, we first need to answer a simple question; what does it really mean to be a full stack developer? A <strong>full stack developer</strong> can be defined as a software engineer who has the skill to work on both the frontend and the backend of an application. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The frontend of a web application is basically anything related to the user interface of the application. For web applications, the technologies that are needed to build the user interface are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In production environments, an application can support different types of frontends, depending on the device by which the user is viewing the web application. F<span>or example, a</span> frontend on a mobile smartphone may need different rules to accommodate the limited screen size of the device, compared to a screen size of a large desktop monitor. </p>
<p><span>In order to make the application perform the tasks it is expected to do, t</span>he backend of a web application consists of all the software layers that need to communicate with the frontend of the application. The backend includes the database layers, the security layer, the user request-handling layer, all the API layers, and more. The backend of a web application can be written in any mature programming language. We will obviously be using Go as our backend language for this book.</p>

<p>Throughout this book, we will build a full stack web application from scratch. The application will be called GoMusic; it's a store for musical instruments written in React.js and Go. The following screenshot demonstrates how the main page will look:</p>

<p>Users will be able to browse the musical instruments in the store, buy what they like with their credit cards, and log in to their accounts to see their existing orders.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the architecture of the application that we are going to build in this book.</p>

<p>Our application architecture will be relatively straightforward—we will use the extremely popular React.js framework for our frontend code, and then we will use the powerful Gin framework for our backend code. Gin comes with a wide array of useful packages that we will be using to build our web application. We will also make use of the <strong>Go object-relational mapping</strong> (<strong>GORM</strong>) package, which is one of the most popular <strong>object-relational mapping</strong> (<strong>ORM</strong>) layers in the Go language:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2ae44141-1450-4865-82be-1f0bb16c515c.png" style="width:31.25em;height:29.17em;"/></p>
<p>We'll build our application piece by piece, starting from the frontend, and then moving to the backend. We will cover some very important concepts in the world of modern web applications, such as reactive UIs, RESTful APIs, security, ORMs, credit card handling, testing, benchmarking, and more. </p>
<p>As we cover these different topics, we'll cover the majority of the code involved in building the application. </p>
<p>In the next section, we'll take a tour to discover the outline of this book, and what each chapter will cover.</p>
