<p>In this chapter, we'll take the first step and learn about the upper half of the full stack, which is the frontend. To properly build any software product, you need to have sufficient practical knowledge to build a good-looking user interface. This is vital for building a software product that other people enjoy using. </p>
<p>We'll discuss the powerful React framework, which is one of the most popular frontend frameworks on the market today. React allows you to build dynamic websites that can respond to data changes in real time. This allows you to build websites that are responsive and intelligent. Most of the popular websites on the internet today are built with React. We'll be covering React from a very practical point of view, so we will dive head-on into how to write React apps, instead of tackling theoretical or side topics.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to construct React applications</li>
<li>Installing React</li>
<li>JSX and React elements</li>
<li>React components</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>States</li>
<li>React developer tools</li>
</ul>

<p>The React framework simply consists of a collection of JavaScript modules that we can use to build beautiful, responsive UIs. Because of that, you need some JavaScript knowledge to follow this chapter. </p>
<p>A very good resource to get re-introduced to JavaScript can be found at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript</a>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll be primarily using ES6, which can simply be considered the new version of JavaScript.</p>
<p>There are four core features of ES6 that we'll come across in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: A class can be considered as a<span> </span><em>special function</em><span> </span>in JavaScript, where you can define internal methods. For more information, please visit <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Arrow functions</strong>: An arrow function is JavaScript's version of an anonymous function. For more information, please visit <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong><span> </span><kbd>let</kbd> <strong>keyword</strong>: The <kbd>let</kbd><span> </span>keyword is used to declare a <span>block scope </span>local variable. For more information, please visit <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong><span> </span><kbd>const</kbd> <strong>keyword</strong>: The<span> </span><kbd>const</kbd><span> </span>keyword is used to declare local scope variables that are constant and cannot change from their initial value. For more information, please visit <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const</a>.</li>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In this chapter, we'll leverage the power of React to build a products page for the GoMusic store. The GoMusic store is the main full stack project that we'll be building throughout this book, and it is basically an online store of musical instruments. The frontend will be built with React, whereas the backend will be built with Go. </p>
<p>Here is the product page we're building today:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/42570f36-5716-480d-aa15-884886a5549a.png" style="width:42.92em;height:51.50em;"/></p>
<p>We'll follow a step-by-step approach to building this page. This web page will not be ordinary. We'll make use of the powerful React development tools to update this page in real time whenever we make a change. To further demonstrate the capabilities of React and its tools, the web page will rely on a JSON file, which will contain information about the images, the names, the prices, and the descriptions of the musical instruments we are trying to sell. Whenever we update the JSON file, the web page will automatically update with the new information in the JSON file.</p>
<p>To build the GoMusic website, we require Node.js and <strong>Node Package Manager</strong> (<strong>npm</strong>), which we will see in the following section.</p>

<p>We'll also be using the npm. The <span>npm is a very popular package that hosts almost all well-known Node.js and JavaScript packages. We need the npm to install React as well as the helper tools we will be using to build our React applications.</span></p>
<p>The npm typically gets distributed with Node.js. So, if you already have a recent version of Node.js installed on your computer, the npm should be there as well.</p>
<p>If you don't have Node.js already installed, please go to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en/</a> to install Node.js on your computer. Make sure that you have the latest versions of the tools involved. So, if you have Node, but it's an older version, go ahead and update it to a newer version.</p>
<p>You can find more information about npm installation at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm</a>.</p>

<p>This chapter focuses primarily on React and it assumes familiarity with frontend basics such as HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>Some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS should be enough for you to understand this chapter. HTML is the language that's used to build web pages, whereas CSS is the language that's used to style web pages (add colors and so on).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span>If you were exposed to HTML and CSS in the past, that should be enough. </span>However, if you prefer to explore HTML more before you proceed, check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML</a>. For exploring CSS, this link is a great resource: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS</a>.</p>
<p>We will utilize the powerful Bootstrap 4 framework to build our frontend views, so familiarity with Bootstrap will help in this chapter as well.</p>
<p>You can find information regarding Bootstrap at <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most practical ways to get started with Bootstrap is to use their startup template, which can be found here: <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template" target="_blank">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template</a>.</p>

<p>React (or React.js) is a JavaScript library for building web user interfaces; it was first released by Facebook in 2013, and has grown exponentially in popularity since then. The library is currently being maintained by Facebook, Instagram, as well as a passionate community. React can build performant and interactive websites.</p>
<p>In the next section we see how to construct React applications.</p>

<p>To <span>understand and build applications in </span>React, you must first understand how the library works, and the pieces that work together to compose your React application. In this section, we'll explain the sequence of steps you need to follow to build a React application. </p>
<p>Here is the simplest way to explain how to build a React app:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create <em>React elements</em> for your application:<br/>
<ul>
<li>An element is one of the most basic building blocks in React. It represents a piece of visual user interface, such as an image, a line with bold font, or a button.</li>
<li>You create an element by employing a mixture of JSX, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wrap your <em>elements</em> with React components:
<ul>
<li>A component is simply a JavaScript class or a function that is composed of React elements.</li>
<li>A React application is mostly a number of React components that exchange data.</li>
<li>An example of a component would be a single product card from our products page:
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/27cc65bb-a900-45f1-8a8f-53c579ca85ae.png" style="width:17.58em;height:25.58em;"/></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use <em>props</em> to pass data between your React components:
<ul>
<li>A prop allows one component to send data to another component</li>
<li>In our project, props is how we pass the product image, name, prices, and description to the product card component</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use <em>state</em> to manage and change data inside your React components:
<ul>
<li>Unlike a prop, a React <kbd>state</kbd> object is internal to your React component</li>
<li>Whenever the data in your <kbd>state</kbd> object changes, the React library re-renders the parts of your application that were affected by the data change</li>
<li>In our project, the <kbd>state</kbd> object is what changes whenever new products are added to our product page</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next section we will set up our React project.</p>

<p>It's time to set up our React project. In this section, we'll install the tools that are needed to get our project ready to start writing a React application.</p>

<p>Now, we need to install React. Fortunately, this step was made simple by the introduction of a powerful tool called Create React App<span>. This tool bundles a number of features that allow us to create new React apps, construct them in real-time, and then build them so that they're ready for production. </span></p>
<p>The tool can be retrieved through the npm package manager. To install the tool, you need to run the following command:</p>
<pre class="gatsby-code-bash"><strong><span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token function">install</span> -g create-react-app</strong></pre>
<p>This command will install the tool globally, which will allow you to use the tool from anywhere.</p>
<p>Now, in the Terminal, go to the folder where you want your tool to run. To create a new React app in that folder, run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>create-react-app first-react-tutorial</strong></pre>
<div class="packt_tip">Make sure you have the latest version of Node and npm installed in order to avoid errors.</div>
<p>This will create a brand new application called <kbd>first-react-tutorial</kbd>, under a new folder with the same name.</p>
<p>Once the app is created, we are ready to write some code. But first, let's see how this new app looks; navigate to the app folder, and then run the <kbd>npm start</kbd> script. Here is how it looks:</p>
<pre><strong>cd first-react-tutorial<br/>npm start</strong></pre>
<p>This will run your brand new React app on local port <kbd>3000</kbd>, it should also open a browser to view the new app, and the URL will be <kbd>http://localhost:3000</kbd><em>.</em> Here is how a vanilla React app looks<em>:<br/></em></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Preparing the new project</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p> The React app that gets generated using the Create React App tool comes with a lot of features. For the purpose of this chapter, we only need to write a simple React app; here is how the generated app folder structure looks:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7fe07c5c-7faa-44d7-ba09-bfb881a3beab.png" style="width:7.75em;height:10.25em;"/></p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll mainly focus on building a simple React app, so we don't need some of the fancy features that come with the generated app. To simplify things, let's delete all the files and folders inside the <kbd>src</kbd> folder of the generated app. After that, let's just create a single empty JavaScript file called <kbd>index.js</kbd>. Here is how this will look:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b1066469-be92-49e8-ba8a-cba43a375c53.png" style="width:8.25em;height:12.42em;"/></p>
<p>Perfect—now, we are ready to write our simple products page. The first step is to include Boostrap in our HTML so that we can make use of Bootstrap's powerful styling. If you open the <kbd>public</kbd> folder, you will find an <kbd>index.html</kbd> file. This file contains some initial HTML that you can use in your React app. We'll modify this HTML file a bit to integrate Bootstrap, and we'll also include a <kbd>div</kbd> with an ID called <kbd>root</kbd>. Here's how <kbd>index.html</kbd> should look after the changes:</p>
<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br/>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br/>  &lt;head&gt;<br/>    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br/>    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"&gt;<br/>    &lt;!-- Bootstrap CSS --&gt;<br/>    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-WskhaSGFgHYWDcbwN70/dfYBj47jz9qbsMId/iRN3ewGhXQFZCSftd1LZCfmhktB" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;<br/><br/>    &lt;meta name="theme-color" content="#000000"&gt;<br/>    &lt;!--<br/>      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is added to the<br/>      homescreen on Android. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/<br/>    --&gt;<br/>    &lt;link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json"&gt;<br/>    &lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico"&gt;<br/>    &lt;!--<br/>      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.<br/>      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.<br/>      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.<br/><br/>      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will<br/>      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.<br/>      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.<br/>    --&gt;<br/>    &lt;title&gt;React App&lt;/title&gt;<br/>  &lt;/head&gt;<br/>  &lt;body&gt;<br/>    &lt;noscript&gt;<br/>      You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.<br/>    &lt;/noscript&gt;<br/>    &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br/>    &lt;!--<br/>      This HTML file is a template.<br/>      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.<br/><br/>      You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.<br/>      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the &lt;body&gt; tag.<br/><br/>      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.<br/>      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.<br/>    --&gt;<br/>    &lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>    &lt;script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>    &lt;script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-smHYKdLADwkXOn1EmN1qk/HfnUcbVRZyYmZ4qpPea6sjB/pTJ0euyQp0Mk8ck+5T" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>  &lt;/body&gt;<br/>&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>You can just copy the preceding code and paste it into the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file inside your <kbd>public</kbd> folder.</p>
<p>The next step is to put the musical instrument's images in your project. You can download the images from this project's GitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Full-Stack-Development-with-Go/tree/master/Chapter04/public/img">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Full-Stack-Development-with-Go/tree/master/Chapter04/public/img</a>.</p>
<p>Go ahead and create a new folder called <kbd>img</kbd> inside your <kbd>public</kbd> folder; copy all the images to that folder.</p>
<p>The next step is to create a JSON file that describes each musical instrument that we would like to show on the product page. As we mentioned previously, our React app will rely on this JSON file to figure out which products to view. The file is called <kbd>cards.json</kbd>, and here is what we should put there initially:</p>
<pre>[{<br/> "id" : 1,<br/> "img" : "img/strings.png",<br/> "imgalt":"string",<br/> "desc":"A very authentic and beautiful instrument!!",<br/> "price" : 100.0,<br/> "productname" : "Strings"<br/>}, {<br/> "id" : 2,<br/> "img" : "img/redguitar.jpeg",<br/> "imgalt":"redg",<br/> "desc":"A really cool red guitar that can produce super cool music!!",<br/> "price" : 299.0,<br/> "productname" : "Red Guitar"<br/>},{<br/> "id" : 3,<br/> "img" : "img/drums.jpg",<br/> "imgalt":"drums",<br/> "desc":"A set of super awesome drums, combined with a guitar, they can product more than amazing music!!",<br/> "price" : 17000.0,<br/> "productname" : "Drums"<br/>},{<br/> "id" : 4,<br/> "img" : "img/flute.jpeg",<br/> "imgalt":"flute",<br/> "desc":"A super nice flute combined with some super nice musical notes!!",<br/> "price" : 210.0,<br/> "productname" : "Flute"<br/>}]</pre>
<p>Now, our <kbd>public</kbd> folder should look like this:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f290eb24-ea70-44f0-8fcf-189c3ebe9c73.png" style="width:13.42em;height:25.33em;"/></p>

<p>JSX can be defined as an extension for JavaScript that looks a whole lot like HTML. JSX can be used in React to create React elements. Basically, if you know HTML, you know JSX! In React docs, React elements are simply defined as a description of what you want to see on the screen.</p>
<p><span>React actually does not require JSX to work—you can replace JSX with some vanilla JavaScript. However, JSX is recommended when developing React applications, and is embraced by the vast majority of the React community. </span>Let's look at some examples. </p>
<p>Remember the <span class="packt_screen">Buy</span> button from the products page?</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7e81287c-6562-45b4-a504-53801f88c4bd.png" style="width:4.58em;height:3.25em;"/></p>
<p>This button is a visual element that we can describe with JSX, as follows:</p>
<pre><span>&lt;</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"#"</span><span> </span><span>className</span><span>=</span><span>"btn btn-primary"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Buy</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></pre>
<p>You can see that JSX looks similar to HTML. The only major difference between the two that we'll note in this chapter is the fact that in JSX, we use the <kbd>className</kbd> keyword instead of <kbd>class</kbd> when we define the class name that our element belongs to. In the preceding code snippet, I made use of Bootstrap's CSS to style my element.</p>
<p>Another difference between JSX and HTML is that JSX makes use of the camel-case naming convention. For example, the <kbd>tabindex</kbd> HTML property becomes <kbd>tabIndex</kbd> in JSX.</p>
<p>The Bootstrap button component can be found at <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/buttons/" target="_blank">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/buttons/</a>. The <kbd>href</kbd> attribute doesn't point to a real link because we are only building the frontend piece.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Because JSX is a JavaScript extension, you can integrate it in your JavaScript code with ease. For example, you can simply do this:</p>
<pre><span>const btnElement = &lt;</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"#"</span><span> </span><span>className</span><span>=</span><span>"btn btn-primary"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Buy</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;;<br/></span></pre>
<p>You can embed JavaScript code inside JSX by using curly brackets. For example, we can do something like this:</p>
<pre><span>const btnName = "Buy";<br/>const btnElement = &lt;</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"#"</span><span> </span><span>className</span><span>=</span><span>"btn btn-primary"</span><span>&gt;{btnName}</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;;<br/></span></pre>
<p>Or, you can do something like the following code snippet: </p>
<pre><span>const btnName = "Buy";<br/>const btnClass = "btn btn-primary"; <br/>const btnElement = &lt;</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"#"</span><span> </span><span>className</span><span>={btnClass}</span><span>&gt;{btnName}</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;;</span></pre>
<p>An element can have children, similar to how we would think of HTML elements. For example, here is an example of a parent <kbd>div</kbd> element that includes the button element as a child:</p>
<pre><span>&lt;div className="card-body"&gt;<br/>   &lt;</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"#"</span><span> </span><span>className</span><span>=</span><span>"btn btn-primary"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Buy</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;<br/>&lt;/div&gt;</span></pre>
<p>React elements are cheap to create since they are just plain objects. To render a React element into the <strong>Document Object Model</strong> (<strong>DOM</strong>), we use <kbd>ReactDOM.render ()</kbd>, as follows:</p>
<pre><span>const btnElement = &lt;</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"#"</span><span> </span><span>className</span><span>=</span><span>"btn btn-primary"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Buy</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;;<br/></span>ReactDOM.render(btnElement,document.getElementById('root'));</pre>
<p>The preceding code will render the button element into a root DOM node.</p>
<p>Now, we have enough information to build one of our product cards using JSX. As a reminder, here is what a product card looks like:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/64502737-fd89-4188-817e-7c9293d5aabd.png" style="width:15.00em;height:22.33em;"/></p>
<p>Let's assume that we already have the product information as variables, as follows:</p>
<pre>const img = <span>"img/strings.png";<br/></span>const imgalt = "string";<br/>const desc = <span>"A very authentic and beautiful instrument!!";<br/></span>const price = 100;<br/>const productName = "Strings";</pre>
<p>With this information at our disposal, here is how we can write a React element in JSX to represent a product card:</p>
<pre> &lt;div className="col-md-6 col-lg-4 d-flex align-items-stretch"&gt;<br/>     &lt;div className="card mb-3"&gt;<br/>         &lt;img className="card-img-top" src={img} alt={imgalt} /&gt;<br/>         &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;<br/>             &lt;h4 className="card-title"&gt;{productname}&lt;/h4&gt;<br/>             Price: &lt;strong&gt;{price}&lt;/strong&gt;<br/>             &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;{desc}&lt;/p&gt;<br/>             &lt;a href="#" className="btn btn-primary"&gt;Buy&lt;/a&gt;<br/>     &lt;/div&gt;<br/>    &lt;/div&gt;<br/> &lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>Except for the use of <kbd>className</kbd> instead of <kbd>class</kbd>, and the use of curly brackets, <kbd>{}</kbd>, to host the JavaScript code, the preceding code looks exactly like a piece of HTML code. We simply built a <kbd>div</kbd> element with several children.</p>
<p>In the preceding code snippet, we used <kbd>div</kbd> tags, an <kbd>img</kbd> tag, an <kbd>h4</kbd> tag, and an <kbd>a</kbd> tag to build our React element. All of those tags are well-known HTML tags that any frontend developer would probably encounter every day.</p>
<p>For styling, I used the power of Bootstrap to make our product card look beautiful. We used Bootstrap's grid system to ensure that the card will be positioned nicely on the browser's screen. </p>
<p>We also utilized Boostrap's wonderful card component, which can be found here: <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/card/" target="_blank">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/card/</a>.</p>

<p>After constructing the elements that represent your visual views, you will need to wrap them with React components to be able to properly use them in your React project.</p>
<p>A React component is typically composed of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>React elements, which we discussed in the <em>JSX and React elements</em> section</li>
<li>Props, which we will discuss in the <em>Props</em> section</li>
<li>State, which we will discuss in the <em>State</em> section</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we jump into props and state, let's cover some basics. A component is typically written as a JavaScript class or a function. Let's write a simple component to get a feeling for what they are really about.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Remember the card element we covered in the <em>JSX and React elements</em> section? Here is how it looked:</p>
<pre> &lt;div className="col-md-6 col-lg-4 d-flex align-items-stretch"&gt;<br/>     &lt;div className="card mb-3"&gt;<br/>         &lt;img className="card-img-top" src={img} alt={imgalt} /&gt;<br/>         &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;<br/>             &lt;h4 className="card-title"&gt;{productname}&lt;/h4&gt;<br/>             Price: &lt;strong&gt;{price}&lt;/strong&gt;<br/>             &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;{desc}&lt;/p&gt;<br/>             &lt;a href="#" className="btn btn-primary"&gt;Buy&lt;/a&gt;<br/>     &lt;/div&gt;<br/>    &lt;/div&gt;<br/> &lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>In a React production app, we need to write a component that hosts this element. Here is how the React component will look:</p>
<pre>import React from 'react';<br/>class Card extends React.Component {<br/>     render() {<br/>         const img = "img/strings.png";<br/>         const imgalt = "string";<br/>         const desc = "A very authentic and beautiful instrument!!";<br/>         const price = 100;<br/>         const productName = "Strings";<br/>         return (<br/>             &lt;div className="col-md-6 col-lg-4 d-flex align-items-stretch"&gt;<br/>                 &lt;div className="card mb-3"&gt;<br/>                     &lt;img className="card-img-top" src={img} alt={imgalt} /&gt;<br/>                     &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;<br/>                         &lt;h4 className="card-title"&gt;{productname}&lt;/h4&gt;<br/>                         Price: &lt;strong&gt;{price}&lt;/strong&gt;<br/>                         &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;{desc}&lt;/p&gt;<br/>                         &lt;a href="#" className="btn btn-primary"&gt;Buy&lt;/a&gt;<br/>                     &lt;/div&gt;<br/>                 &lt;/div&gt;<br/>             &lt;/div&gt;<br/>         );<br/>     }<br/>}</pre>
<p>In our project's <kbd>src</kbd> folder, copy the preceding code to <kbd>index.js</kbd>. </p>
<p>Now, let's inspect the preceding code. Here is what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>A React component is a JavaScript class that inherits the <kbd>React.Component</kbd> type</li>
<li>The most important method in a React component class is <kbd>render()</kbd>, since this method returns the React element that your component produces</li>
<li>A component name starts with an uppercase letter, which is why <kbd>Card</kbd> started with <em>C</em> instead of <em>c</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You might be wondering why a component name has to start with an uppercase letter.</p>
<p>It's because in React, once you create a component, you can use it as a DOM tag in JSX. So to differentiate between a native DOM tag, such as <kbd>div</kbd>, and a component DOM tag, such as <kbd>Card</kbd>, we use upper case as the first letter for components.</p>
<p>Because you can use components as DOM tags in JSX, you can render them with <kbd>reactDOM.render()</kbd>, as follows:</p>
<pre>reactDOM.render(&lt;Card/&gt;,document.getElementById('root'));</pre>
<p>The preceding code will render our component under the <kbd>root</kbd> <kbd>div</kbd> of our HTML document.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the design of the React application in the next section.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Now that we understand components, it's time to discuss how to design a React application with the power of components. A React application is composed of a number of components that talk to each other. There should be a main container component, which acts as an entry point to other components. The React community recommends against writing components that inherit from other components. Instead, the community recommends composition to be used. So, whenever we talk about parent and child components, we don't mean that child components inherit the parent component's classes, we just mean that the parent component contains one or more of the child components.</p>
<p>Composition means that all of your component classes should inherit from <kbd>React.Component</kbd>, and then the parent component renders child components to build your web application. This is best explained by an example.</p>
<p>For our product page, the proper design would involve two components: a <kbd>CardContainer</kbd> component, which will host the list of product cards we are trying to view, and a <kbd>Card</kbd> component, which will represent a single product card.</p>
<p>The <kbd>CardContainer</kbd> component is the parent, and the <kbd>Card</kbd> components are the children:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b9be7f46-5d36-4f6f-9d2a-92c0a22b57e2.png" style="width:20.42em;height:22.67em;"/></p>
<p>Both objects will inherit from <kbd>React.Component</kbd>. The <kbd>CardContainer</kbd> component will render a list of <kbd>Card</kbd> components to build the product page that supports multiple products. However, before we dive into the code for <kbd>CardContainer</kbd>, we need to understand how the <kbd>CardContainer</kbd> will pass the musical instrument product data to <kbd>Card</kbd>, which is what the next section will address.</p>
<p>Let's look at props and state in the next sections.</p>


            </article>

            
        </section>
    

        <section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Props</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>So, this all looks good. However, in reality, since we have multiple products and not just one, we need a list of <kbd>Card</kbd> components, and not just one. It doesn't make sense to hardcode this component multiple times to correspond to each product. So, instead, we want to write the card component once. The <kbd>CardContainer</kbd> component we discussed in the <em>React application design</em> section should pass the product information to the <kbd>Card</kbd> component. So, we basically have a parent component that needs to pass some information to a child component.</p>
<p>You might wonder: why do we need the <kbd>CardContainer</kbd> component to pass data to the <kbd>Card</kbd> component, and not have the <kbd>Card</kbd> component look for its own data? The answer is simple: it was found that the best design for React applications is to have data state handled at the uppermost parent component where the data makes sense, then pieces of the data get passed down to smaller child components as needed. This design allows the child components to be in sync with one another, and in sync with their parents.</p>
<p>In our application, the uppermost component where all the product's information data should be handled is <kbd>CardContainer</kbd>, whereas the smaller child components that only need access to individual product information is handled in the <kbd>Card</kbd> components. In the world of React, this passing of data from parent component to child components is done using the <kbd>props</kbd> object. <span>Props simply stands for properties. </span></p>
<p>To access the properties within any React component, we just need to call <kbd>this.props</kbd>. Let's assume that the product information was already passed to our <kbd>Card</kbd> component using props. Here is how the <kbd>Card</kbd> code will now look:</p>
<pre>import React from 'react';<br/>class Card extends React.Component {<br/>     render() {<br/>         return (<br/>             &lt;div className="col-md-6 col-lg-4 d-flex align-items-stretch"&gt;<br/>                 &lt;div className="card mb-3"&gt;<br/>                     &lt;img className="card-img-top" src={this.props.img} alt={this.props.imgalt} /&gt;<br/>                     &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;<br/>                         &lt;h4 className="card-title"&gt;{this.props.productname}&lt;/h4&gt;<br/>                         Price: &lt;strong&gt;{this.props.price}&lt;/strong&gt;<br/>                         &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;{this.props.desc}&lt;/p&gt;<br/>                         &lt;a href="#" className="btn btn-primary"&gt;Buy&lt;/a&gt;<br/>                     &lt;/div&gt;<br/>                 &lt;/div&gt;<br/>             &lt;/div&gt;<br/>         );<br/>     }<br/>}</pre>
<p>In the preceding code, we simply accessed the <kbd>props</kbd> object through <kbd>this.props</kbd>, and since we assumed that the product information was already passed to us through props, the <kbd>props</kbd> object had all the information that we needed.</p>
<p>So, now comes the important question: how was the information passed from the parent component (<kbd>CardContainer</kbd>, in our case) to the child components (<kbd>Card</kbd>, in our case) using props?</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The answer is quite simple; since a component name becomes a DOM tag in JSX, we can simply represent a component in JSX, as follows:</p>
<pre><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Card</span><span> </span><span>img</span><span>=</span><span>"img/strings.png"</span><span> </span><span>alt</span><span>=</span><span>"strings"</span><span> </span><span>productName</span><span>=</span><span>"Strings"</span><span> </span><span>price</span><span>=</span><span>'100.0'</span><span> </span><span>desc</span><span>=</span><span>"A very authentic and beautiful instrument!!"</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span></pre>
<p>In the preceding code, we utilized JSX to create a React element that represents a single product card component. The element tag name is <kbd>Card</kbd>, whereas the props are passed as attributes in JSX. If you look at the <kbd>Card</kbd> component code that we covered right before this, you will find that the names of the props correspond to the attribute names we passed within the React element that we created previously. In other words, the props were <kbd>img</kbd>, <kbd>alt</kbd>, <kbd>productName</kbd>, <kbd>price</kbd>, and <kbd>desc</kbd>. Those were the same names as the attributes in the preceding React element.</p>
<p>So, let's create a very simple <kbd>CardContainer</kbd> component that hosts only two cards, and see how this looks. Based on what we know so far, to create a React component, you need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a class that inherits from <kbd>React.Component</kbd></li>
<li>Override the <kbd>render()</kbd> method of <kbd>React.Component</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how the code looks:</p>
<pre>class CardContainer extends React.Component{<br/> render(){<br/>     return(<br/>         &lt;div&gt;<br/>             &lt;Card key='1' img="img/strings.png" alt="strings" productName="Strings" price='100.0' desc="A very authentic and beautiful instrument!!" /&gt;<br/>             &lt;Card key='2' img="img/redguitar.jpeg" alt="redg" productName="Red Guitar" price='299.0' desc="A really cool red guitar that can produce super cool music!!" /&gt;<br/>         &lt;/div&gt;<br/>     );<br/>  }<br/>}</pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>There are two important things that we need to cover from the preceding code:</p>
<ul>
<li>We put the two cards inside a parent <kbd>div</kbd> element. This is important because the <kbd>render()</kbd> method needs to return a single React element.</li>
<li>We added a <kbd>key</kbd> attribute, even though it was not part of the <kbd>Card</kbd> component. The key property is a reserved property in React. Keys are important to use when working with lists of elements. Keys must be unique for each item. A key only needs to be unique on an item, compared to its sibling items. In our case, we have a list of cards, so that's why we used the <kbd>key</kbd> prop. React uses keys to figure out which items would need to get re-rendered, and which items stayed the same. A React component cannot access the <kbd>key</kbd> property through the <kbd>props</kbd> object. React monitors whether keys get added, removed, or changed. Then, it makes decisions on which components need to get re-rendered, and which components don't need to be touched. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <kbd>render()</kbd> method in the preceding code can actually get refactored further:</p>
<pre>render() {<br/>  //hardcoded card list<br/>   const cards = [{<br/>    "id" : 1,<br/>    "img" : "img/strings.png",<br/>    "imgalt":"string",<br/>    "desc":"A very authentic and beautiful instrument!!",<br/>    "price" : 100.0,<br/>    "productname" : "Strings"<br/>   }, {<br/>    "id" : 2,<br/>    "img" : "img/redguitar.jpeg",<br/>    "imgalt":"redg",<br/>    "desc":"A really cool red guitar that can produce super cool music!!",<br/>    "price" : 299.0,<br/>    "productname" : "Red Guitar"<br/>  }];<br/> //get a list of JSX elements representing each card<br/>   const cardItems = cards.map(<br/>    card =&gt; &lt;Card key={card.id} img={card.img} alt={card.imgalt} productName={card.productname} price={card.price} desc={card.desc} /&gt;<br/>   );<br/>   return (<br/>     &lt;div&gt;<br/>       {cardItems}<br/>     &lt;/div&gt;<br/>    );<br/> }</pre>
<p>In the preceding code, we still hardcode the product card information for simplicity, but this time we use JavaScript's <kbd>map()</kbd> method to create a list of React elements. We then include our elements inside a parent <kbd>div</kbd> element, and return it as the result of our <kbd>render()</kbd> method.</p>
<p>The preceding code can actually get refactored even further, since it's a bit verbose to assign every single attribute with a value from a card item. Instead, React supports the following syntax:</p>
<pre>const cardItems = cards.map(<br/>     card =&gt; &lt;Card key={card.id} {...card} /&gt;<br/> );</pre>
<p>In the preceding syntax, we just used <kbd>...</kbd> to pass all the properties of a card item to a <kbd>Card</kbd> component. This code works because the properties of the card object have the same names as the properties that are expected through the <kbd>props</kbd> object by the <kbd>Card</kbd> component. We still explicitly assigned the <kbd>key</kbd> attribute, because the <kbd>Card</kbd> object didn't have a <kbd>key</kbd> property—it had an <kbd>id</kbd> property instead.</p>
<p>The <kbd>CardContainer</kbd> component becomes the entry component to our product page, instead of the <kbd>Card</kbd> component. This means that we should render <kbd>CardContainer</kbd> instead of <kbd>Card</kbd> under the <kbd>root</kbd> div of our HTML document:</p>
<pre>ReactDOM.render(<br/>     &lt;CardContainer /&gt;,<br/>     document.getElementById('root')<br/>);</pre>

<p>The last major topic we need to cover in regards to the React library is the <kbd>state</kbd> object. We already learned that we use the <kbd>props</kbd> objects to pass data from one component to another. However, we can't just hardcode our data in a production-level application like we did in the <em>Props</em> section. The musical instruments' product information needs to be obtained from somewhere, and not hardcoded in our React code. In a real application, the data should come from a server-side API. However, for the purpose of this chapter, we'll obtain the product information from a JSON file called <kbd>cards.json</kbd>. In React, our application data needs to live inside the <kbd>state</kbd> object. </p>
<p class="mce-root">Let's take a look at how to initialize and set our <kbd>state</kbd> object in the next section.</p>

<p>The <kbd>state</kbd> object should be initialized at the constructor of the React component class that needs this state. For our product page, the data we need to store is simply the product information. Here is us initializing the <kbd>state</kbd> object:</p>
<pre>class CardContainer extends React.Component {<br/> constructor(props) {<br/>   //pass props to the parent component<br/>   super(props);<br/>   //initialize the state object for this component<br/>   this.state = {<br/>    cards: []<br/>   };<br/> }<br/> <br/> /*<br/> Rest of the card container code<br/> */<br/>}</pre>
<p>A constructor for a component object expects <kbd>props</kbd> as an argument, so the first thing we need to do is pass <kbd>props</kbd> to the parent <kbd>React.Component</kbd> object. </p>
<p>The second step is to initialize the <kbd>state</kbd> object of our component. <kbd>state</kbd> objects are internal to our components, so the <kbd>state</kbd> object we initialize here is not shared with other components. Our <kbd>state</kbd> object will contain a list called <kbd>cards</kbd>, and is where we will store our musical instrument product card list. </p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting our state</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The next obvious step is to set our <kbd>state</kbd> object with a list of product cards. To set data in a React <kbd>state</kbd> object, we must use a method called <kbd>setState()</kbd>, which belongs to our component object. Here is an example of us setting our <kbd>state</kbd> object with the information of two product cards:</p>
<pre>this.setState({<br/>    cards: [{<br/>            "id" : 1,<br/>            "img" : "img/strings.png",<br/>            "imgalt":"string",<br/>            "desc":"A very authentic and beautiful instrument!!",<br/>            "price" : 100.0,<br/>            "productname" : "Strings"<br/>        }, {<br/>            "id" : 2,<br/>            "img" : "img/redguitar.jpeg",<br/>            "imgalt":"redg",<br/>            "desc":"A really cool red guitar that can produce super cool music!!",<br/>            "price" : 299.0,<br/>            "productname" : "Red Guitar"<br/>        }]<br/>});</pre>
<p>The <kbd>render()</kbd> method of our <kbd>CardContainer</kbd> component will need to change to look like this:</p>
<pre>render(){<br/>     const cards = this.state.cards;<br/>        let items = cards.map(<br/>            card =&gt; &lt;Card key={card.id} {...card} /&gt;<br/>        );<br/>        return (<br/>            &lt;div className='container pt-4'&gt;<br/>                &lt;h3 className='text-center text-primary'&gt;Products&lt;/h3&gt;<br/>                &lt;div className="pt-4 row"&gt;<br/>                    {items}<br/>                &lt;/div&gt;<br/>            &lt;/div&gt;<br/>        );<br/>}</pre>
<p>In the preceding code, we did two main things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtained the product card information from our <kbd>state</kbd> object</li>
<li>Added some extra styling using the Bootstrap framework to make our product page look better</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, we are still hardcoding our product data inside our component code, which is not right. As we mentioned earlier, our list of product card data needs to be in a file called <kbd>cards.json</kbd>, which we created in the <em>Preparing the new project</em> section. We need to add some code to grab data from this file, and then change the state accordingly. We will use the <kbd>fetch()</kbd> method, which is common in modern browsers, to obtain the contents of the <kbd>cards.json</kbd> file, and then we'll populate the state with the obtained data:</p>
<pre>fetch('cards.json')<br/> .then(res =&gt; res.json())<br/> .then((result) =&gt; {<br/>     this.setState({<br/>     cards: result<br/> });<br/>});</pre>
<p>The preceding code is more than enough to fill up our <kbd>state</kbd> object. In a real production app, we would fetch an API address instead of a local file. But where should we put that code?</p>
<p>In React components, there are some life cycle methods that are supported. A life cycle method is a method that gets called whenever component life cycle events occur. An example of a component life cycle event is when the component gets mounted into the tree—the method that gets called whenever this event happens is called <span><kbd>componentDidMount()</kbd>. When you override this method, any code you write there will get executed whenever your component mounts. It is advised to write initialization code that involves loading data from remote locations in <kbd>componentDidMount()</kbd>. In our case, we are not really loading data from a remote location, since the</span> <kbd>card.json</kbd> <span>file is local to our app, however in a real production application, the data will live remotely. So, let's just write our initialization code inside <kbd>componentDidMount()</kbd> with the understanding that <kbd>fetch()</kbd> will need to change in the future to grab the data from a remote API:</span></p>
<pre>componentDidMount() {<br/>     fetch('cards.json')<br/>     .then(res =&gt; res.json())<br/>     .then((result) =&gt; {<br/>         this.setState({<br/>         cards: result<br/>         });<br/>     });<br/> }</pre>
<p>Perfect—this was the last piece of code we needed to finish up our <kbd>CardContainer</kbd> component. Here is how the entire class looks:</p>
<pre>class CardContainer extends React.Component {<br/> constructor(props) {<br/> super(props);<br/> this.state = {<br/> cards: []<br/> };<br/> }<br/><br/> componentDidMount() {<br/> fetch('cards.json')<br/> .then(res =&gt; res.json())<br/> .then((result) =&gt; {<br/> this.setState({<br/> cards: result<br/> });<br/> });<br/> }<br/><br/> render() {<br/> const cards = this.state.cards;<br/> let items = cards.map(<br/> card =&gt; &lt;Card key={card.id} {...card} /&gt;<br/> );<br/> return (<br/> &lt;div className='container pt-4'&gt;<br/> &lt;h3 className='text-center text-primary'&gt;Products&lt;/h3&gt;<br/> &lt;div className="pt-4 row"&gt;<br/> {items}<br/> &lt;/div&gt;<br/> &lt;/div&gt;<br/> );<br/> }<br/>}</pre>
<p>We have covered enough ground to learn how to build a working application in React.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Developer tools</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The React community is indeed a very passionate one. Facebook has released a bunch of tools that can be used to debug and troubleshoot React apps; you can find the repository for the dev tools at <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools" target="_blank">https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools</a>. The dev tools are available as a Chrome extension, a Firefox extension, or as a standalone app. </p>
<p>For the purpose of this chapter, we'll have a brief look at the Chrome extension, which you can find at <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi" target="_blank">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi</a>.</p>
<p>Once you install the Chrome React Developer Tools extension, you can run it from Chrome's developer tools:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/91af201e-ebb8-4184-95f4-00c5acb48f46.png" style="width:32.08em;height:20.75em;"/></p>
<p>Once you open Chrome's developer tools, you will find a <span class="packt_screen">React</span> tab in your developer tools pane:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/eead50c4-e5ad-4a2d-8d61-c6bc0377c69f.png" style="width:56.83em;height:35.92em;"/></p>
<p>You will find your React components in this window. The entry to the React component to our product page was <kbd>CardContainer</kbd>, as shown in the preceding screenshot.</p>
<p>For each component that's exposed through the dev tools, you can dive deeper into the children components and their properties:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c1d1fef8-8de7-4dfe-ab95-f124c681d20a.png" style="width:88.08em;height:46.42em;"/></p>
<p>This will allow you to further inspect your React app and troubleshoot it properly, without much complexity. I advise that you take a moment to try out the dev tools for yourself and explore what they can do.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned how to design and build a working React application. We covered all the key pieces that make React work, such as React elements, components, props, and states. We also learned about JSX and how similar it is to HTML. <span>Once you learn React, you will find it a very enjoyable framework to build web products with. There is a reason why it is so popular with developers worldwide. </span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll utilize the knowledge we gained here to build the frontend of our GoMusic website.</p>
