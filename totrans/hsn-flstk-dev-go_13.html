<p class="mce-root"><span>Cloud-native applications are an important topic for people looking to take their applications to the point of being infinitely scalable to growing user needs and expanding data loads. <strong>Cloud-native applications</strong> can be defined as applications built to run on a distributed and scalable infrastructure. They are expected to always be available, reliable, capable of getting updates in real time, and not crumble under pressure. They typically rely on redundancy, load balancing, and various other techniques to achieve their objectives. The topic is not trivial by any measure. In fact, entire books have been dedicated to how to build cloud-native applications. In this section, we'll cover some key technologies utilized in the construction of cloud-native applications. </span></p>
<p class="mce-root">Cloud-native applications are not always deployed to a <em>cloud</em>, such as AWS or Azure. They could be deployed to an organization's internal infrastructure that supports scalability. </p>
<p>In the next sections. we'll take a look at microservices, container, serverless applications and continuous delivery which are some of the important concepts of cloud-native applications</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Microservices</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Microservice is a very popular concept in modern software. It's the idea of dividing your application's tasks into small self-contained software services. So, instead of having a large application that covers a wide array of tasks, you utilize a microservice for each task. Microservices allow your application to be very scalable.</p>
<p>The concept of microservice is the opposite of the concept of a monolithic application, which is the kind of application where all the tasks are coded together.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a monolithic application that represents an event booking application:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dadb8d6f-94cf-46f6-b070-1989832752e1.png" style="width:26.42em;height:15.83em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>And here is how a</span> microservice <span>application represents the same event booking application:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1ea40d49-7a48-4a49-a15c-00cbde9f8fce.png" style="width:48.17em;height:26.50em;"/></p>
<p>Each block in the preceding diagram represents a microservice that is tasked with one specific task.</p>
<p><span>You can spread your microservices over multiple server nodes, achieving load balancing on multiple systems. You can make your microservices redundant, so that if one service goes down, another one picks up the work as if nothing happened. This redundancy can also be very useful when deploying patches and updates to your application.</span></p>
<p>Here is an example diagram of our microservices now supporting redundancy to ensure the application will always <span>be </span>available. If one of the services goes down due to maintenance, or system crashes, the other service will take over:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ca3c1d2a-0f63-4261-aa62-bfbfbcfe5cb5.png" style="width:48.50em;height:28.42em;"/></p>
<p>Even though microservices offer tons of scalability and flexibility in an application, they can be challenging to maintain in the long run, especially if your architecture grows to hundreds or thousands of microservices. Some special monitoring tools will be needed to ensure they are properly maintained and looked after. </p>
<p>In the next section, we'll discuss the concept of containers.</p>

<p>Containers technology is a relatively new technology. However, it has grown in popularity to the point that it has become a key piece of infrastructure software in the world of cloud-native applications. Containers allow you to surround your software with an isolated user space or a <em>container</em>.</p>
<p>Containers are very useful in deploying and running scalable microservices because they allow your microservices to run in an isolated space that contains all the microservice configurations, environmental variables, dependencies, runtimes, and any other files or settings needed for the service. </p>
<p>Containers allow software developers to deploy isolated services in the same server nodes, ensuring that your services are run unaffected by any other services on the same node. Containers also allow developers to deploy a microservice with everything the microservice needs to run in one go through a container image. Containers are not only used for microservices; they can also be used in any piece of software that can benefit from being in a container, such as database engines. F<span>or example, u</span>sing a container image to deploy MySQL is a popular approach to deploying and running MySQL with relative ease. One of the most popular container technologies nowadays is Docker (<a href="https://www.docker.com">https://www.docker.com</a>).</p>
<p>Here is an example of some containers running on a server node:</p>

<p>Serverless applications are another relatively new technology in the world of cloud-native applications. They are mostly used for tasks that don't need to run continuously. To properly understand the concept of serverless applications, let's go through an example.</p>
<p>Consider Amazon's AWS Lambda service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/</a>), which is utilized by numerous applications worldwide.<span> In order to perform a specific task, t</span>he service allows users to request a function to run remotely. So, in other words, you ask AWS Lambda to run some code for you. After the code is executed, the output is returned to you. No stateful data is maintained. The code or function that runs on Lambda is provided by you. </p>
<p>Serverless applications make use of services such as AWS Lambda in order to run intermittent tasks that are not expected to run all the time. This provides scalability for your application, because it relieves the need to maintain software services just to execute temporary tasks. Services such as AWS Lambda are also known as <strong>FaaS</strong> (<strong>function as a service</strong>).</p>
<p>Here is an example application where some services are substituted by functions:</p>

<p>Continuous delivery is the idea that software should be released in fast and short cycles, as opposed to longer and slow ones. Continuous delivery allows organizations to effectively and continuously improve their software by being able to release improvements and fixes all the time. </p>
<p>Continuous delivery is not just about using software tools; it also involves a way of thinking that the entire organization needs to adhere to. There needs to be a process where any additions to the software can be quickly built, tested, and deployed/delivered. </p>
<p>Continuous delivery proved to be very practical and effective for organizations running cloud-native applications because it allows incremental and fast improvements, as opposed to huge step changes that can break the software in production. It is important to automate the process as much as possible in order to gain the most benefits.</p>
<p>Let's take a glimpse at the popular React Native framework for building mobile apps in the next section.</p>

<p>In this book, we covered how to design and write a React app from the ground up. This is a very powerful skill in modern software. React is currently being used to power some of the most popular websites on the internet. Another powerful advantage of learning React.js is the fact that your skills could be utilized to build cross-platform mobile applications through React Native.</p>

<p>React Native (<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">https://facebook.github.io/react-native/</a>) is an open source project developed by Facebook. It makes use of the features of the React.js framework to build cross-platform mobile applications that can run on Android or iOS. React Native is very popular, and is currently being used by organizations big and small to build practical mobile apps.</p>
<p>One major advantage of React Native is that almost all the code you write would work on both Android and iOS devices. This means that you only have to worry about a single code base for almost your entire application. Another major advantage is that React Native uses native APIs for the targeted platform. This is why mobile applications written in React Native tend to have better performance than applications written by other JavaScript mobile frameworks.</p>
<p>In the next section, we'll take a look at some of the differences between React.js and React Native.</p>

<p>Here are some of the differences between React.js and React Native:</p>
<ul>
<li>React Native has its own special JSX syntax to build UI components. By default, it does not make use of CSS and HTML like React.js.</li>
<li>React Native relies on some special libraries to interface with mobile devices. For example, you need to use React-Native-specific packages to write code around a phone camera or accelerometer.</li>
<li>Deploying React Native apps is a different experience to deploying React.js, since the deployment into mobile device with all its app rules. </li>
