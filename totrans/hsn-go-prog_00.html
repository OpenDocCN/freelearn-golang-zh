<p>This book will help you learn Go programming language by solving problems developers commonly face using a recipe approach. You will start by installing Go binaries and become familiar with the tools needed to develop applications. Then you will manipulate strings and use them in built-in constructions and built-in function constructs to create a complex value from two floating-point values. After that, you will learn how to perform arithmetic operations with date and time along with parsing them from string values.</p>
<p>Whether you are an expert programmer or a fresh starter, you will learn how various solutions are programmed in Go, which will take you to the next level in your mastery of Go. These recipes range from concurrency in Go, performing various web programming tasks, doing system programming, reading and writing files, and many fundamental Go programming skills such as proper error handling and doing logging.</p>

<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>I'm going to use the <kbd>touch</kbd> command</span> <span>to create the </span><kbd>main.go</kbd><span> file.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>package main<br/>import "fmt"<br/>func main(){<br/> fmt.Println(a:"Hello World")<br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$go run main.go</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "You can just run it and keep clicking <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span> until the installation is complete.</span><span>"</span></p>
