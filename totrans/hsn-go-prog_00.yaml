- en: This book will help you learn Go programming language by solving problems developers
    commonly face using a recipe approach. You will start by installing Go binaries
    and become familiar with the tools needed to develop applications. Then you will
    manipulate strings and use them in built-in constructions and built-in function
    constructs to create a complex value from two floating-point values. After that,
    you will learn how to perform arithmetic operations with date and time along with
    parsing them from string values.

    various solutions are programmed in Go, which will take you to the next level
    in your mastery of Go. These recipes range from concurrency in Go, performing
    various web programming tasks, doing system programming, reading and writing files,
    and many fundamental Go programming skills such as proper error handling and doing
    logging.
