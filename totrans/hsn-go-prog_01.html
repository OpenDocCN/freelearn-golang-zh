<p>Let's get started with Go. In this section, we will learn how to install Go binaries and briefly take a look at the Go language.</p>
<p>To install the Go binaries, the first thing to do is to navigate to the following link: <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">https://golang.org/doc/install</a>; you can also access it if you search for it <span>directly </span>in Google. You'll find a step-by-step guide to installing Go on different platforms and operating systems. If you click on <span class="packt_screen">Download Go</span>, it will take you to the <span class="packt_screen">Downloads</span> page, where you can find various binary formats.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>You'll find MSI for Windows, Linux, and macOS, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-671 image-border" src="assets/cc1f0180-dd8d-4c29-88bf-3e936a68fed2.png" style="width:46.83em;height:32.17em;"/></p>
<p>I'll be <span>using macOS,</span> but you'll find the steps similar with other platforms as well. Let's go ahead with the download.</p>
<p>The installer is basically a step-by-step wizard; you can just run it and keep clicking <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span> until the installation is complete. After you've installed it, you may want to do one more thing, and that is, set your environment variable. Furthermore, you will have to set up your workspace. You'll have three folders, <kbd>bin</kbd>, <kbd>pkg</kbd>, and <kbd>src</kbd>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-672 image-border" src="assets/ad693586-b8d7-4898-b568-296ea7bd9c88.png" style="width:43.83em;height:31.75em;"/></p>
<p>The <kbd>src</kbd> folder is where you put your source files, the <kbd>pkg</kbd> folder is where Go stores your object files, and the <kbd>bin</kbd> folder is where the binaries, which are the actual executables, are stored. Moving ahead, I'm going to be using my shell and you need to set a couple of environment variables by using <kbd>export</kbd>. You can also use profile files to set your environment variable. If you check the following screenshot, you can see the path <kbd>$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin</kbd>, and this is where my Go binaries are located:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-673 image-border" src="assets/a05dd85f-116b-482c-83c9-2b17140c83d1.png" style="width:39.42em;height:28.67em;"/></p>
<p>So, when I run the <kbd>Go</kbd> command, it will automatically find where the Go program is located.</p>
<p>Next, we set the <kbd>GOPATH</kbd>. The <kbd>GOPATH</kbd> is basically where your Go workspace is located. The workspace, if you remember, contains three folders, <kbd>pkg</kbd>, <kbd>src</kbd>, and <kbd>bin</kbd>. <kbd>GoProject</kbd> is the parent folder of that structure. The last is <kbd>$GOPATH/bin</kbd>, which is used when you want your terminal to find the installed Go binaries. Just make sure that you're adding these three things and saving this file before restarting your terminal. Then, you will be good to Go!</p>
<p><span>You can also find out how to set environment variables for a Go path by clicking the link, shown in the following screenshot, which is on the same page:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-674 image-border" src="assets/ece31944-4fa2-4491-8969-1db2b04813f2.png" style="width:47.25em;height:30.67em;"/></p>
<p><span>You'll find instructions for different operating systems. For instance, for Unix-based systems, you can use <kbd>~/.bash_profile</kbd> or, depending on which shell you're using, you can use various profile files. In mine, I use the profile as seen in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-675 image-border" src="assets/2ec25741-dc7c-4fb6-b138-7fcda340d3f4.png" style="width:45.17em;height:33.25em;"/></p>
<p><span>For Windows, following installation, and once you have your Go workspace, follow the instructions given and you are pretty much good to Go. The instructions will look like the following screenshot:</span></p>

<p><span>The quickest way to test whether you have Go installed is to just type in <kbd>go</kbd>, as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-677 image-border" src="assets/ae4661b5-6535-46c1-8ed7-1e5ca5c58cf2.png" style="width:28.58em;height:10.50em;"/></p>
<p><span>It will bring up the help tutorial, and you can see the available commands and which version of code you have by using the Go version.</span></p>
<p><span>That's how you can easily set up your Go environment.</span> <span>In the next section, we will take a quick look at the Go language itself.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>In this section, we're going to take a quick look at the Go programming language. Go is an expressive, concise, and clean language; it has concurrency mechanisms, and this helps programmers to write programs that get the most out of multi-core and networking machines. It also compiles quickly to machine code and has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of runtime reflection. It is a statically typed-in, compiled language, but, for most, it feels like a dynamically typed and interpreted language. All right then! Let's look at the syntax of Go by navigating to <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1</a>; this is a good starting point for those who want to learn Go syntax:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-678 image-border" src="assets/0531d92f-0fa8-49d2-b0a5-5fe4de42171d.png" style="width:54.92em;height:27.67em;"/></p>
<p>OK, So if you look at the syntax in the screenshot, and if you come from languages such as Java and C#, or C and C++, you may find the syntax a little bit different. For instance, if you look at the return type, instead of defining the type, you actually define the return types at the end of your function. We also have a main function, which is the entry point of our application, similar to many other programming languages, and if you look at the context shown in the following screenshot, you can see that we have packages, variables, and functions, and flow control statements:  <kbd>for</kbd>, <kbd>if...else</kbd>, and <span>types such as <kbd>struct</kbd>, <kbd>slices</kbd>, and <kbd>maps</kbd>:</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-679 image-border" src="assets/2aff032d-e205-49a6-a873-da00529d102e.png" style="width:52.08em;height:27.50em;"/></p>
<p>If you want to create a class, such as structure, you can use a struct type and combine it with a pointer. Additionally, it has methods and interfaces and concurrency, but it doesn't have generics.</p>
<p>Having said that, I will also talk about the tools that I'm going to be using throughout this book. There are a couple of tools available in <strong>GoLand</strong>. GoLand is a relatively new IDE by JetBrains. We will be using GoLand throughout the book. You can easily create new projects and give them a name and choose the SDK, which is Go 1.9. You can also add new files or new packages, and so on.</p>
<p>You can define your configurations, and build your Go, by typing your entry file, as shown in the following screenshot. <span>You can then</span> run <span> </span><kbd>main.go</kbd> <span>and click</span> <span class="packt_screen">OK:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-680 image-border" src="assets/ef4f11d9-cb81-44f4-a70b-f72f7bcf9fdf.png" style="width:38.08em;height:29.33em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Finally, pressing <em>Ctrl </em>+ <em>r</em> will build your project, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-681 image-border" src="assets/c3e1bc05-93d5-4ec2-95ae-1da7786c8ce7.png" style="width:51.50em;height:33.67em;"/></p>
<p>Before I conclude this chapter, let me quickly show you an example that uses just the terminal. I'm going to use the  <kbd>touch</kbd> command to create the <kbd>main.go</kbd> file and add the following code:</p>
<pre>package main<br/>import "fmt"<br/>func main(){<br/> fmt.Println(a:"Hello World")<br/>}</pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>You can run it by using the <kbd>go run main.go</kbd> command and you will get the following output:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-682 image-border" src="assets/ed40c885-8935-47d5-8781-bf553c172e2f.png" style="width:28.50em;height:10.08em;"/></p>
<p>You can save it and then run it. So, this is how you can use the terminal to quickly write Go code and run it.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we have learned how to install Go binaries and taken a brief look at the Go language. We have learned how to write Go code and run it using just the terminal. We have also looked at the tools that are going to be used throughout all chapters and what other tools can be used to develop Go applications. We are now ready to move on to the next chapter, where we will see some recipes for manipulating string values.</p>
