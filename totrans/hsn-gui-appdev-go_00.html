<p>Since the 1.0 release of the Go programming language in 2012, developers have enjoyed the increased productivity brought by the easy-to-read, quick-to-learn, cross-platform design of Go. Web apps and system utilities around the world are being built with Go to rapidly deliver reliable performance. Learning the language is easy, due to its centralized documentation and great programming environment support. Creating <strong>Graphical User Interfaces</strong> (<strong>GUIs</strong>) with Go, however, is still very new and there is not yet a standardized UI toolkit.</p>
<p>This definitive guide to programming GUIs with Go explores the most popular GUI packages available. It compares the vision behind each toolkit to help you pick the right approach for your project. Each toolkit is described in detail, outlining how to build beautiful, performant applications that users will love. Code samples and screenshots will aid any level of Go developer to create applications using these emerging technologies.</p>

<p>This book is written for Go developers who are interested in building native graphical applications for desktop computers and beyond. Some knowledge of building Go applications (command line based or web apps) is assumed, but not essential. The first section of this book looks at the history of the GUI, its importance to the evolution of modern personal computers, and how it can pose additional challenges to software developers.</p>
<p>Developers of GUI applications that are interested in trying Go may also find this book useful. <a href="36bfea00-c659-4569-864c-de2c460c7467.xhtml"/><a href="36bfea00-c659-4569-864c-de2c460c7467.xhtml">Section 2</a>, <em>Toolkits Using Existing Widgets</em> and <a href="ab9e1a04-12c8-4239-938e-9cac4c604b65.xhtml">Section 3</a>, <em>Modern Graphical Toolkits,</em> explore the various frameworks available to the Go language and demonstrate how applications can be rapidly developed from basic principles.</p>
<p>Additionally, an experienced Go developer may find the final section useful. The chapters of <a href="935a315b-9890-4c6a-a126-3dda28108886.xhtml">section 4</a>, <em>Growing and Distributing Your Application </em>covers how to design and build complex graphical interfaces that fit user expectations. It looks at the different approaches possible to support multiple operating system standards and how to integrate the GUI well with network resources and cloud services. The final chapters cover best practices in GUI applications with Go, and look at how to package and distribute your software through the various distribution channels available.</p>

<p>To benefit the most from later chapters, it would be ideal if you have in mind a particular application you are working on or would like to build. Applying the frameworks and tools used in this book to a particular project will aid your understanding of the various concepts. Additionally, this will deliver the benefit of you completing your project and preparing it for distribution.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>html, body, #map {<br/> height: 100%; <br/> margin: 0;<br/> padding: 0<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>[default]<br/>exten =&gt; s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)<br/>exten =&gt; s,2,Voicemail(u100)<br/><strong>exten =&gt; s,102,Voicemail(b100)</strong><br/>exten =&gt; i,1,Voicemail(s0)</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ mkdir css</strong><br/><strong>$ cd css</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
