- en: Since the 1.0 release of the Go programming language in 2012, developers have
    enjoyed the increased productivity brought by the easy-to-read, quick-to-learn,
    cross-platform design of Go. Web apps and system utilities around the world are
    being built with Go to rapidly deliver reliable performance. Learning the language
    is easy, due to its centralized documentation and great programming environment
    support. Creating **Graphical User Interfaces** (**GUIs**) with Go, however, is
    still very new and there is not yet a standardized UI toolkit.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This definitive guide to programming GUIs with Go explores the most popular
    GUI packages available. It compares the vision behind each toolkit to help you
    pick the right approach for your project. Each toolkit is described in detail,
    outlining how to build beautiful, performant applications that users will love.
    Code samples and screenshots will aid any level of Go developer to create applications
    using these emerging technologies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is written for Go developers who are interested in building native
    graphical applications for desktop computers and beyond. Some knowledge of building
    Go applications (command line based or web apps) is assumed, but not essential.
    The first section of this book looks at the history of the GUI, its importance
    to the evolution of modern personal computers, and how it can pose additional
    challenges to software developers.

    this book useful. [Section 2](36bfea00-c659-4569-864c-de2c460c7467.xhtml), *Toolkits
    Using Existing Widgets* and [Section 3](ab9e1a04-12c8-4239-938e-9cac4c604b65.xhtml), *Modern
    Graphical Toolkits,* explore the various frameworks available to the Go language
    and demonstrate how applications can be rapidly developed from basic principles.

    The chapters of [section 4](935a315b-9890-4c6a-a126-3dda28108886.xhtml), *Growing
    and Distributing Your Application *covers how to design and build complex graphical
    interfaces that fit user expectations. It looks at the different approaches possible
    to support multiple operating system standards and how to integrate the GUI well
    with network resources and cloud services. The final chapters cover best practices
    in GUI applications with Go, and look at how to package and distribute your software
    through the various distribution channels available.
