- en: Let's look first at graphical app toolkits for Go that use existing widgets.
    These toolkits help you build applications that will match the operating system's
    look and feel, which is a great choice if you want to build an app that's immediately
    familiar to your users. This approach may have a downside, however, in the amount
    of testing and potential customization required for each platform you aim to support.
    The APIs we explore have different levels of abstraction and platform integration,
    so depending on your application's requirements, the effort required may vary.

- en: This section covers three different approaches to creating GUIs that match the
    operating system. Firstly, we'll look at Walk, which is a Go API that's specifically
    for creating Windows applications. This is the most direct way to create the app
    you wish for the Microsoft Windows desktop, but it's not obviously portable to
    other platforms. After that, we'll switch to andlabs/ui, which is an abstraction
    for Windows, macOS, Linux, and other widget sets. The application built in that
    chapter will use native platform widgets while being portable to many platforms.
    After then, we'll look at themeable widget sets, which behave the same way across
    multiple platforms and load themes that match the native user interface. In this
    category, we'll set up applications using Go bindings for the GTK+ and Qt toolkits.

    Walk API. If you are developing for a different operating system, then this chapter
    may be less relevant, so you can jump to [Chapter 5](4b414e87-1c86-4d14-b88b-cb3e01c1fabe.xhtml), *andlabs
    UI - Cross-Platform Native UIs, *where we move on to andlabs UI.
