- en: In the four chapters of [Section 2](36bfea00-c659-4569-864c-de2c460c7467.xhtml), *Toolkits
    Using Existing Widgets,* we explored various graphical toolkits that provide a
    Go application different ways to work with existing widget sets. These toolkits
    provide Go APIs for either native widgets (such as CommonControls in Windows or
    the Cocoa widgets in macOS) or existing cross-platform toolkits (GTK+ and Qt).
    These widget sets are tried and tested, often supported by commercial companies,
    and have established developer tools to support their features (though not all
    functionality is available to the Go bindings). Applications built using these
    GUI APIs will vary in look according to the platform they are running on. This
    may, or may not, be desirable behavior.

    Toolkits,* will look at graphical toolkits designed specifically for the Go language.
    As part of their design, each of these aim to look and feel identical across all
    the operating systems they support. Doing so means breaking from traditional widget
    design and layout to some extent, and most of these APIs have taken the opportunity
    to bring in inspiration from more modern sources to design their solution.

- en: As libraries that are designed specifically for the Go language, they fit well
    with the standard libraries, making them easy to learn and integrate with other
    Go packages. As part of a cross-platform toolkit, they also aim to reduce the
    complexity of cross-compiling applications for easier distribution. Applications
    built with these toolkits are typically small, meaning quick download times, and
    can be expected to run quickly due to less code being loaded than more established
    cross-platform solutions.
