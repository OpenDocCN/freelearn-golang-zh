<p>Throughout <a href="36bfea00-c659-4569-864c-de2c460c7467.xhtml">Section 2</a>, <em>Toolkits Using Existing Widgets</em>, and <a href="ab9e1a04-12c8-4239-938e-9cac4c604b65.xhtml">Section 3</a>, <em>Modern Graphical Toolkits</em>, we have looked in detail at the most popular toolkits available for building graphical applications with the Go language. Each framework has a different background and vision and many vary in the platforms they support. You may already have a strong idea about which is the best API for your next application, but irrespective of the technology you plan to use, there are many other things to consider in building and managing a growing or complex graphical application.</p>
<p>In this section, we will look at various topics related to more substantial GUIs than those that we explored in the earlier chapters. We will cover what you will need to consider when designing more complicated graphical interfaces, and how to manage them on different platforms. Concurrency and network programming are often a challenge when applications connect to modern cloud and distributed services, so we will look at how these can be integrated into applications using the Go language and standard libraries.</p>
<p>At the end of this section, we will turn to managing your code and applications as they grow. We will cover best practices for developing graphical applications and how they apply to the Go language. Lastly, we will prepare our applications for distribution, looking at how the benefit of cross-platform development can lead to complications when we want to deploy our software.</p>
