    Using Existing Widgets*, and [Section 3](ab9e1a04-12c8-4239-938e-9cac4c604b65.xhtml), *Modern
    Graphical Toolkits*, we have looked in detail at the most popular toolkits available
    for building graphical applications with the Go language. Each framework has a
    different background and vision and many vary in the platforms they support. You
    may already have a strong idea about which is the best API for your next application,
    but irrespective of the technology you plan to use, there are many other things
    to consider in building and managing a growing or complex graphical application.

    GUIs than those that we explored in the earlier chapters. We will cover what you
    will need to consider when designing more complicated graphical interfaces, and
    how to manage them on different platforms. Concurrency and network programming
    are often a challenge when applications connect to modern cloud and distributed
    services, so we will look at how these can be integrated into applications using
    the Go language and standard libraries.

    as they grow. We will cover best practices for developing graphical applications
    and how they apply to the Go language. Lastly, we will prepare our applications
    for distribution, looking at how the benefit of cross-platform development can
    lead to complications when we want to deploy our software.
