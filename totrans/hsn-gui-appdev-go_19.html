<p>In preparation for running the code examples in this book, you will need to have both the Go compiler and a C compiler installed (to support Cgo). If either of these are not set up, this appendix will guide you through the installation.</p>

<p>As a relatively new programming language, Go doesn't come pre-installed on many operating systems. This section steps through setting it up for any readers who haven't already done so.</p>

<p>Configuring a development environment for Windows can be complicated as there aren't many tools installed by default. Due to this, there are many options for setting up using external tools and packages (such as MSYS, MinGW, and Ubuntu Subsystem) but exploring these is out of the scope of this book. Thankfully, it's possible to start developing Go applications without the need for many additional development tools.</p>

<p>Firstly, if you haven't already done so, you need to download and install Git. The download is available at <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a>, and it should start automatically when you visit that page. Run the file that's downloaded, and the setup will start (if a notice says this isn't verified then tap the <span class="packt_screen">Install Anyway</span> button). The default options should work for most users—make sure that <span class="packt_screen">Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt</span> is selected to avoid more work later on.</p>
<p>Once this is completed, open a Command Prompt window (search for <kbd>cmd</kbd> from the <span class="packt_screen">Start</span> menu if you don't have a shortcut) and type <kbd>git --version</kbd>—you should see something like the following output:</p>

<p>Next, you should install Go—that can be found at <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">https://golang.org/dl/</a>. On this page, choose the featured Microsoft Windows download (the name will end in <kbd>.msi</kbd>). As with the Git installation, you'll need to run the downloaded file and possibly confirm that you would like to continue installing an unverified program. Once again, the default values should be suitable—if you change any of the configuration, make sure to update the following lines appropriately.</p>
<p>Once that installer has finished, return to your Command Prompt and type <kbd>go version</kbd>, which should output the version number and quit:</p>

<p>If the preceding installations succeeded, then your environment should be correctly configured. If you made some changes during the installation, you may need to make some adjustments to your environment configuration:</p>

<p>In the preceding output, you can see that <kbd>Git\bin</kbd>, <kbd>Go\bin</kbd>, and <kbd>%GOPATH%</kbd> are included in your <kbd>%PATH%</kbd> environment for finding executable files. If this isn't the case, you may need to log out or reboot for the settings to take effect.</p>

<p>Many developer tools (including Git) are installed as part of the <kbd>XCode</kbd> package. If you haven't already installed Xcode for other development work, you can download it for free from the Mac App Store. Once installed, you should also set up the command-line tools—to do this go to the Xcode menu and select <span class="packt_screen">Preferences</span>, then <span class="packt_screen">Downloads</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Install Command Line Tools</span>.</p>
<p>If you're unsure about whether or not you've installed these already, then open the Terminal application and execute <kbd>xcode-select</kbd>—if installed, that will execute normally, and if not, you'll be prompted to run the installation:</p>

<p>In addition to these tools, you'll need to install Go.

You may need to close any open Terminal windows to update your environment variables.</p>

<p>Setting up the prerequisite software on Linux should only require installing the correct packages for your distribution. The <kbd>git</kbd> package will provide the source control tools and the Go language should be in the <kbd>go</kbd> or <kbd>golang</kbd> package. Installing these will provide the necessary commands to run the examples in this book. You may need to add <kbd>~/go/bin</kbd> to your <kbd>PATH</kbd> environment variable to be able to run tools that Go installs later.</p>

<p>To use most of the libraries and functionality explored in this book, you'll also need to use Cgo (the built-in Go to C language bridge). Cgo requires the availability of a C compiler and some related tools depending on the operating system. This section outlines how to set them up.</p>

<p><span>For Cgo to function on Windows, you'll need to have the <kbd>gcc</kbd> (or compatible) compiler installed. If Visual Studio is already installed, then you may have a C compiler. For those who don't, this section steps through configuring a build environment on the command line. The easiest way to get up and running (in my experience) is to download and install MSYS2 (a software distribution) and build a platform for Windows. Using MSYS2, we can install the <kbd>mingw-w64</kbd> packages, which provide an updated distribution of the <em>gcc for Windows</em> project named <strong>mingw</strong>.</span></p>
<p>Download the installer from <a href="http://www.msys2.org/">www.msys2.org/</a>—choose either the 32 bit (i686) or 64 bit (x86_64) versions, depending on your computer architecture. Once downloaded, run this installer, which will download the basic packages to your computer, including the package manager (pacman). Once complete, it'll launch the MSYS Command Prompt, which will be used for any projects requiring Cgo. You'll need to update the <kbd>PATH</kbd> environment variable to use the existing Go and Git installations:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">An MSYS console provides access to many additional packages</div>
<p>Once you have the command line set up, the package manager is used to install a C compiler and toolchain as well as <kbd>pkg-config</kbd> (which is used by Cgo to find packages):</p>
<pre><strong>pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain <span>mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config</span></strong></pre>
<p>Once complete, you'll be able to execute <kbd>gcc</kbd> and <kbd>pkg-config</kbd> from the MSYS command line—these tools are essential for a working Cgo setup. The following output may display an error, but it shows that the tools are found:</p>

<p>To enable Cgo support on macOS, you'll need the development tools included with the Xcode distribution. If you've done development work on your Macintosh computer before, or if you followed the previous instructions for installing Git tools, you'll already have this installed. If you've installed Xcode but not used the command-line tools before, then you can install these from a Terminal window with the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>xcode-select --install</strong></pre>
