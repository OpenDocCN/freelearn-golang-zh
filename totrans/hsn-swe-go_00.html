<p>Over the last few years, Go has gradually turned into one of the industry's favorite languages for building scalable and distributed systems. The language's opinionated design and built-in concurrency features make it relatively easy for engineers to author code that efficiently utilizes all available CPU cores.  </p>
</div>
<div style="font-weight: 400">
<p>This book distills the industry's best practices for writing lean Go code that is easy to test and maintain and explores their practical implementation by creating a multi-tier application from scratch called 'Links 'R' Us.' You will be guided through all the steps involved in designing, implementing, testing, deploying, and scaling the application. You'll start with a monolithic architecture and iteratively transform the project into a <strong>Service-Oriented Architecture</strong> (<strong>SOA</strong>) that supports efficient out-of-core processing of large link graphs. You will learn about various advanced and cutting-edge software engineering techniques such as building extensible data-processing pipelines, designing APIs using gRPC, and running distributed graph processing algorithms at scale. Finally, you will learn how to compile and package your Go services using Docker and automate their deployment to a Kubernetes cluster. </p>
</div>
<div style="font-weight: 400">
<p>By the end of this book, you will start to think like a professional developer/engineer who can put theory into practice by writing lean and efficient Go code. </p>

What's more, the chapter summarizes the basic software design life cycle models that every <strong>software engineer</strong> (<strong>SWE</strong>) should be aware of.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><a href="96fb70cb-8134-4156-bd3e-48ca53224683.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em><span>Best Practices for Writing Clean and Maintainable Go Code</span></em><span>, explains how the SOLID design principles can be applied to Go projects and provides useful tips for organizing your Go code in packages and writing code that is easy to maintain and test.</span></p>
<p><a href="bdd8b231-e9fa-4522-8497-66d77231b7f3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em><span>Dependency Management</span></em><span>, highlights the importance of versioning Go packages and discusses tools and strategies for vendoring your project dependencies.</span></p>
<p><a href="d279a0af-50bb-4af2-80aa-d18fedc3cb90.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em><span>The Art of Testing</span></em><span>, advocates the use of primitives such as stubs, mocks, spies, and fake objects for writing comprehensive unit tests for your code. Furthermore, the chapter enumerates the pros and cons of different types of tests (for example, black- versus white-box, integration versus functional) and concludes with an interesting discussion on advanced testing techniques such as smoke testing and chaos testing.</span></p>
<p><a href="6e4047ad-1fc1-4c3e-b90a-f27a62d06f17.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>The Links 'R' Us project</em><span>, introduces the hands-on project that we will be building from scratch in the following chapters.</span></p>

<p>To get the most out of this book and experiment with the accompanying code, you need to have a fairly good understanding of programming in Go as well as sufficient experience working with the various tools that comprise the Go ecosystem.</p>
<p>In addition, the book assumes that you have a solid grasp of basic networking theory.</p>
<p>Finally, some of the more technical chapters in the book utilize technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. While a priori knowledge of these technologies is <em>not strictly required</em>, any prior experience using these (or equivalent) systems will certainly prove beneficial in better understanding the topics discussed in those chapters.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "In the following code, you can see the definition of a generic <kbd>Sword</kbd> type for our upcoming game."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre><span class="fontstyle0">type Sword struct {<br/>  name string // Important tip for RPG players: always name your swords!<br/>}<br/>// Damage returns the damage dealt by this sword.<br/>func (Sword) Damage() int {<br/>  return 2<br/>}</span> <br/> </pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><span class="fontstyle0">type Sword struct {<br/>  name string // Important tip for RPG players: always name your swords!<br/>}<br/>// Damage returns the damage dealt by this sword.<br/>func (Sword) Damage() int {<br/>  <strong>return 2</strong><br/>}</span> </pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "The following excerpt is part of a system that collects and<br/>
publishes performance metrics to a <strong>key-value</strong> store.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
