<p class="mce-root">At this point, I would like to congratulate you on completing this book and extend to you a big thanks for taking the time to read every single chapter up to the very end. I sincerely hope that you had as much pleasure reading this book as I had writing it and that you can take some of the principles and concepts that we discussed through these pages and apply them to your current and future Go projects.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Having said that, I have a small favor to ask of you. Should you locate any errors either in the content of this book or the accompanying code, please don't hesitate to reach out and let me know. What's more, I would certainly love hearing your thoughts on the topics that were addressed in this book! You can contact me either via Packt Publishing or through this book's GitHub repository.</p>
<p class="mce-root">If you are up to the challenge, here is a list with a few interesting ideas that you can try next to further your understanding of both this book's material and its accompanying code:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Support crawling for dynamic pages that render their content with the help of JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, and so on. Add a headless browser to the mix so that the crawler can execute JavaScript code and process the content of the rendered page.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Reduce the impact of the crawler component on remote servers. Modify the link submission page of the frontend so that webmasters can specify a preferred time window for crawling a particular domain. Then, update the crawler implementation <span>to take this information into account when scheduling the refresh interval for</span> <span>each individual link.</span></li>
<li class="mce-root">Update the crawler to recognize and honor the contents of <kbd>robots.txt</kbd> files <span><span>when deciding whether to crawl links from a particular domain.</span></span></li>
<li class="mce-root">Leverage the <kbd>bspgraph</kbd> package from <a href="c505ec2d-0bd8-4edd-97e1-d06de2b326a5.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Graph-Based Data Processing</em>,Â to implement other popular graph-based algorithms and then execute them in a distributed fashion by switching your code so that it uses the <kbd>dbspgraph</kbd> package from <a href="67abdf43-7d4c-4bff-a17e-b23d0a900759.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Building Distributed Graph-Processing Systems</em>. If you are unsure of where to start, try implementing one of the following algorithms:
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Check whether a graph is bipartite.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Determine whether a graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Detect whether a directed graph contains cycles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add support for checkpoints to the <kbd>dbspgraph</kbd> package's implementation. After a configurable number of super-steps, the master node should ask every worker to create <span>a checkpoint of their current state. If a worker crashes, the master should then instruct</span> <span>workers to load their state from the last known checkpoint, redistribute</span> <span>the UUID ranges among the remaining workers, and resume the execution of the computation job.</span></li>
</ul>
