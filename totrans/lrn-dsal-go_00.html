<p class="mce-root"><em>Learn Data Structures and Algorithms with Go</em> covers topics related to simple and advanced concepts in computer programming. The primary objective is to choose the correct algorithm and data structures for a problem. This book explains the concepts for comparing algorithm complexity and data structures in terms of code performance and efficiency.</p>
<p>Golang has been the buzzword for the last two years, with tremendous improvements being seen in this area. Many developers and organizations are slowly migrating to Golang, adopting its fast, lightweight, and inbuilt concurrency features. This means we need to have a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms with this growing language.</p>

<p>The knowledge we assume is basic programming in a language and mathematical skills related to topics including matrices, set operations, and statistical concepts. The reader should have the ability to write pseudo code based on a flowchart or a specified algorithm. Writing functional code, testing, following guidelines, and building a complex project in the Go language are the prerequisites that we assume in terms of reader skills.</p>
