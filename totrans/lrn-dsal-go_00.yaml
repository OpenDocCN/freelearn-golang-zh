- en: '*Learn Data Structures and Algorithms with Go* covers topics related to simple
    and advanced concepts in computer programming. The primary objective is to choose
    the correct algorithm and data structures for a problem. This book explains the
    concepts for comparing algorithm complexity and data structures in terms of code
    performance and efficiency.'

- en: Golang has been the buzzword for the last two years, with tremendous improvements
    being seen in this area. Many developers and organizations are slowly migrating
    to Golang, adopting its fast, lightweight, and inbuilt concurrency features. This
    means we need to have a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms with
    this growing language.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The knowledge we assume is basic programming in a language and mathematical
    skills related to topics including matrices, set operations, and statistical concepts.
    The reader should have the ability to write pseudo code based on a flowchart or
    a specified algorithm. Writing functional code, testing, following guidelines,
    and building a complex project in the Go language are the prerequisites that we
    assume in terms of reader skills.
