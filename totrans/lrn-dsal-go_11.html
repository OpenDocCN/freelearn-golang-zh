<p class="mce-root"><span>Network representation, sparse matrix representation, memory management, instance based learning, compiler translation, and process scheduling-related data structures and algorithms are presented in this section. The data structures shown in the algorithms are graphs, list of lists, AVL trees, K-D trees, ball trees, Van Emde Boas trees, buffer trees, and red-black trees. Cache-oblivious data structures and data flow analysis are covered with code examples and efficiency analysis.</span></p>
