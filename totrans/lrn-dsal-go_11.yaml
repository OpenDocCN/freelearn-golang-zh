- en: Network representation, sparse matrix representation, memory management, instance
    based learning, compiler translation, and process scheduling-related data structures
    and algorithms are presented in this section. The data structures shown in the
    algorithms are graphs, list of lists, AVL trees, K-D trees, ball trees, Van Emde
    Boas trees, buffer trees, and red-black trees. Cache-oblivious data structures
    and data flow analysis are covered with code examples and efficiency analysis.
