    continues to evolve and gain popularity, I am delighted to present an updated
    edition of this book.

- en: In the rapidly changing landscape of technology, Go has emerged as a language
    of choice for building scalable, performant, and maintainable software. Whether
    you are a seasoned Go developer looking to deepen your expertise or a newcomer
    eager to master the intricacies of the language, this book is your comprehensive
    guide.

- en: If you have an older edition of *Mastering Go,* apart from the first edition,
    which is now pretty old, do not throw it away just because *Mastering Go, Fourth
    Edition,* is out. Go has not changed that much and both the second and third editions
    can still be useful and relevant. However, *Mastering Go, Fourth* *Edition,* is
    better in many aspects than all previous editions and includes information about
    the latest Go versions, which you are not going to find in the previous editions
    of the book.

    services, writing a statistics application, and working with eBPF, as well as
    an entirely new chapter on fuzz testing and observability.

    you, the reader, can tell if I have succeeded or not. Try to do the exercises
    located at the end of each chapter and do not hesitate to contact me about ways
    or ideas to make future editions of this book even better.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *A Quick Introduction to Go*, begins by discussing the history
    of Go, important characteristics of Go, and the advantages of Go, before describing
    the `godoc` and `go doc` utilities and explaining how we can compile and execute
    Go programs. Then, the chapter discusses about controlling program flow, printing
    output and getting user input, working with command line arguments, and using
    log files. In the last part of *Chapter 1*, we develop a basic version of a statistics
    application that we are going to keep improving in forthcoming chapters.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Basic Go Data Types*, discusses the basic data types of Go, both
    numeric and non-numeric; arrays and slices that allow you to group data of the
    same date; Go pointers; constants; and working with dates and times. The last
    part of the chapter is about generating random numbers and populating the statistics
    application with random data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Composite Data Types*, begins by teaching you about maps, before
    going into structures and the `struct` keyword. Additionally, it talks about regular
    expressions, pattern matching, and working with CSV files. Last, it improves the
    statistics application by adding data persistency to it.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Go Generics*, is about Generics and how to use the new syntax
    to write generic functions and define generic data types. This chapter also presents
    the `cmp` package, the `slices` package, and the `maps` package, which are all
    implemented using generics to work with as many data types as possible.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Reflection and Interfaces*, is about reflection, interfaces,
    and type methods, which are functions attached to data types. The chapter also
    covers the use of the `sort.Interface` interface for sorting slices, the use of
    the empty interface, type assertions, type switches, and the `error` data type.
    Additionally, we discuss how Go can mimic some object-oriented concepts before
    improving the statistics application. This chapter also compares generics with
    interfaces and reflection.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Go Packages and Functions*, is all about packages, modules, and
    functions, which are the main elements of packages. Among other things, we create
    a Go package for interacting with a SQLite3 database, create documentation for
    it, and explain the use of the sometimes-tricky `defer` keyword. Last, we talk
    about Workspaces, which is a relatively new Go feature.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Telling a UNIX System What to Do*, is about Systems Programming,
    which includes subjects such as working with command line arguments, handling
    UNIX signals, file input and output, the `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` interfaces,
    and the use of the `viper` and `cobra` packages. Last, we update the statistics
    application to use JSON data and convert it into a proper command line utility
    with the help of the `cobra` package.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Go Concurrency*, discusses goroutines, channels, and pipelines.
    We learn about the differences between processes, threads, and goroutines, the
    `sync` package, and the way the Go scheduler operates. Additionally, we explore
    the use of the `select` keyword and we discuss the various *types* of Go channels
    as well as shared memory, mutexes, the `sync.Mutex` type, and the `sync.RWMutex`
    type. The rest of the chapter talks about the `context` package, the `semaphore`
    package, worker pools, how to time out goroutines, and how to detect race conditions.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Building Web Services*, discusses the `net/http` package, the
    development of web servers and web services, the creation of web clients, and
    the timing out of HTTP connections. We also convert the statistics application
    into a web service and create a command line client for it.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 10*, *Working with TCP/IP and WebSocket*, is about the `net` package,
    TCP/IP, the TCP and UDP protocols, as well as the WebSocket protocol and working
    with RabbitMQ. We develop lots of practical servers and clients in this chapter.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 11*, *Working with REST APIs*, is all about working with REST APIs
    and RESTful services. We learn how to define REST APIs and develop powerful concurrent
    RESTful servers as well as command line utilities that act as clients to RESTful
    services.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 12*, *Code Testing and Profiling*, discusses code testing, code optimization,
    and code profiling, as well as cross compilation, creating example functions,
    the use of `go:generate`, and finding unreachable Go code.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 13*, *Fuzz Testing and Observability*, talks about fuzz testing, which
    is a relatively new addition to the Go programming language, and about observability,
    which refers to the ability to understand, measure, and analyze the internal state
    and behavior of a system based on its external outputs or observable signals.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 14*, *Efficiency and Performance*, is about benchmarking Go code,
    understanding the Go memory model, and eliminating memory leaks. The chapter also
    includes the development of an eBPF utility—eBPF has become a foundational technology
    for improving observability, security, and performance in modern Linux systems.'

    additions, and improvements in the latest Go versions and it will help you understand
    how Go is evolving over time.'
