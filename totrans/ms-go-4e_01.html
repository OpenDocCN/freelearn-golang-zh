<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Despite its name, this chapter is more than just a quick introduction to Go, as it is also going to be the foundation for the rest of the book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">The basics of Go, some design decisions, and the philosophy of Go are explained in this chapter so that you can get the big picture before learning the details of Go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">Among other things, we present the advantages and disadvantages of Go so that you know when to use Go and when to consider other alternatives.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">In the sections that follow, we cover a number of concepts and utilities in order to build a solid foundation of Go, before building a simplified version of the </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">which(1)</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1"> utility, which is a UNIX utility that locates program files by searching the directories of the </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">PATH</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1"> environment variable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Additionally, we explain how to write information in log files, as this can help you store error messages and warnings while you are developing software in Go.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">At the end of the chapter, we develop a basic command line utility that computes basic statistical properties. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">It is that command line utility that we are going to improve and expand in the remaining book chapters as we learn more advanced Go features.</span></p>

<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-16"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">The history of Go</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">As mentioned earlier, Go</span><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1"> started as an internal Google project that went public back in 2009. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Griesemer, Thomson, and Pike designed Go as a language for professional programmers who want to build reliable, robust, and efficient software that is easy to manage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">They designed Go with simplicity in mind, even if simplicity meant that Go was not going to be a programming language for everyone or everything.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">The figure that follows shows the programming languages that directly or indirectly influenced Go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">As an example, Go syntax looks like C, whereas the package concept was inspired by Modula-2.</span></p>
<figure class="mediaobject"> <span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"><img alt="A group of white squares with black text  Description automatically generated with low confidence" src="../Images/B21003_01_01.png"/></span></figure>
<p class="packt_figref"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">Figure 1.1: The programming languages that influenced Go</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">The deliverable was a programming language with tools and a standard library. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">What you get with Go, apart from its syntax and tools, is a rich standard library and a type system that tries to save you from easy mistakes, such as implicit type conversions, unused variables, and unused packages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">The Go compiler catches most of these easy mistakes and refuses to compile until you do something about them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.4">Additionally, the Go compiler can find difficult-to-catch mistakes such as race conditions.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">If you are going to install Go for the first time, you can start by visiting </span><a href="https://go.dev/dl/"><span class="url"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">https://go.dev/dl/</span></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">However, there is a big chance that your UNIX variant has a ready-to-install package for the Go programming language, so you might want to get Go by using your favorite package manager.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">As Go is a portable programming language, almost all presented code is going to work fine on any modern </span><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Microsoft Windows, Linux, or macOS machine without any changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">The only Go code that might need some small or big adjustments is the code that deals with the operating system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.3">Most of that code is covered in </span><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Chapter 7</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Telling a UNIX System What to Do</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-17"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">The advantages of Go</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Go comes with</span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1"> some important advantages for developers, starting with the fact that it was designed and is currently maintained by real programmers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">Go is also easy to learn, especially if you are already familiar with programming languages such as C, Python, or Java. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">On top of that, due to its simplified and elegant syntax, Go code is pleasant to the eye, which is great, especially when you are programming applications for a living and you have to look at code on a daily basis. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.4">Go code is also easy to read, which means that you can make changes to existing Go code easily, and offers support for Unicode out of the box. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.5">Lastly, Go has reserved only 25 keywords, which makes it much easier to remember the language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.6">Can you do that with C++?</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Go also comes with concurrency capabilities, using a simple concurrency model that is implemented using </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">goroutines</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1"> and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">channels</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">Go manages OS threads for you and has a powerful runtime that allows you to spawn lightweight units of work (goroutines) that communicate with each other using channels.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Although Go comes with a rich standard library, there are really handy Go packages, such as </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">cobra</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1"> and </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">viper</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">, that allow Go to develop complex command line utilities such as </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">docker</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1"> and </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">hugo</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">This is greatly supported by the fact that executable binaries are statically linked, which means that once they are generated, they do not depend on any shared libraries and include all required information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">In practice, this means that you can transfer an existing executable file to a different machine with the same architecture and be sure that it is going to run without any issues.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Due to its simplicity, Go code is predictable and does not have strange side effects, and although Go supports pointers, it does not support pointer arithmetic like C, unless you use the </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">unsafe</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> package, which can be the root of many bugs and security holes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">Although Go is not an object-oriented programming language, Go interfaces are very versatile and allow you to mimic some of the capabilities of object-oriented languages, such as polymorphism, encapsulation, and composition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.3">However, Go offers no support for classes and inheritance. </span><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Chapter 5</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Reflection and Interfaces</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">, provides more information on the subject.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Additionally, the latest Go versions offer support for </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">generics</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">, which simplifies your code when working</span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1"> with multiple data types. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">You can learn more about Go generics in </span><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">Chapter 4</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">Go Generics</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">Finally, Go is a garbage-collected language, which means that no manual memory management is needed.</span></p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-18"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">When to use Go</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Although Go is a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1"> general-purpose programming language, it is primarily used for writing system tools, command line utilities, web services, and software that works over networks and the internet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">You can use Go for teaching programming, and it is a good candidate as your first programming language because of its lack of verbosity and clear ideas and principles.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Go can help you develop the following kinds of applications:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Professional web services</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Networking tools and servers such as Kubernetes and Istio</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">Backend systems</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Robust UNIX and Windows system tools</span></li>

<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">gRPC (Remote Procedure Call) servers and clients</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Complex command line utilities with multiple commands, sub-commands, and command line parameters, such as </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">docker</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1"> and </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">hugo</span></code></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">Applications that exchange data in the JSON format</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Applications that process data from relational databases, NoSQL databases, or other popular data storage systems</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">Compilers and interpreters for your own programming languages</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">Database systems such as CockroachDB and key/value stores such as etcd</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">Although Go is a very </span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">practical and competent programming language, it is not perfect:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">This is a personal preference rather than an actual technical shortcoming: Go has no direct and full support for object-oriented programming, which is a popular programming paradigm.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">Although goroutines are lightweight, they are not as powerful as OS threads. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Depending on the application you are trying to implement, there might exist some rare cases where goroutines will not be appropriate for the job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.3">The Apache web server creates UNIX processes with </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">fork(2)</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1"> to serve its clients—Go does not support the functionality of </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">fork(2)</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">However, in most cases, designing your application with goroutines and channels in mind will solve your problems.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">Although garbage collection is fast enough most of the time, and for almost all kinds of applications, there are times when you need to handle memory allocation manually, such as when developing an operating system or working with large chunks of memory and want to avoid fragmentation—Go cannot do that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">In practice, this means that Go will not allow you to perform any memory management manually.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Go does not offer the full functionality of a functional programming language.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Go is not good at developing systems with high availability guarantees. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">In such cases, use Erlang or Elixir instead.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">There are many things that Go does better than other programming languages, including the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">The Go compiler catches a large set of silly errors that might end up being bugs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">This includes imported Go packages and variables that are not being used in the code.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">Go uses fewer parentheses than C, C++, or Java, and no semicolons, which makes Go source code more human-readable and less error-prone.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">Go comes with a rich and reliable standard library that keeps improving.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">Go has support for concurrency out of the box through goroutines and channels.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">Goroutines are lightweight. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">You can easily run thousands of goroutines on any modern machine without any performance issues.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">Unlike C, Go considers functions as first-class citizens.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">Go code is backward compatible, which means that newer versions of the Go compiler accept programs that were created using a previous version of the language without any modifications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">This compatibility guarantee is limited to major versions of Go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.3">For example, there is no guarantee that a Go 1.x program will compile with Go 2.x.</span></li>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">In this subsection, I am going to tell you my personal story of how I ended up learning and using Go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">I am a UNIX person, which means that I like UNIX and prefer to use it whenever possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.3">I also love C, and I used to like C++; I wrote a command line FTP client in C++ for my M.Sc. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.4">project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.5">Nowadays, C++ is just a huge programming language that is difficult to learn. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.6">Although C continues to be a decent programming language, it requires lots of code to perform simple tasks and suffers from difficult-to-find and correct bugs, due to manual memory management and extremely flexible conversion between different data types without any warnings or error messages. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">As a result, I used to use Perl to write simple command line utilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">However, Perl is far from perfect for writing serious command line tools and services, as it is a scripting programming language and is not intended for web development.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">When I first heard about Go, that it was developed by Google, and that both Rob Pike and Ken Thomson were involved in its development, I instantly became interested in Go.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">Since then, I have used Go to create web services, servers, and clients that communicate with RabbitMQ, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, create simple command line utilities, implement algorithms for time series data mining, create utilities that generate synthetic data, etc.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1637.1">All UNIX systems have</span><a id="_idIndexMarker062"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1638.1"> their own log files for writing logging information that comes from running servers and programs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1638.2">Usually, most system log files of a UNIX system can be found under the </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1639.1">/var/log</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1640.1"> directory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1640.2">However, the log files of many popular services, such as Apache and Nginx, can be found elsewhere, depending on their configuration.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1641.1">Logging and storing logging information in log files is a practical way of examining data and information from your software asynchronously, either locally, at a central log server, or using server software such as Elasticsearch, Beats, and Grafana Loki.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1642.1">Generally speaking, using a log file to write some information used to be considered a better practice than writing the same output on screen for two reasons. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1642.2">Firstly, because the output does not get lost, as it is stored on a file, and secondly, because you can search and process log files using UNIX tools, such as </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1643.1">grep(1)</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1644.1">, </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1645.1">awk(1)</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1646.1">, and </span><code class="inlineCode"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1647.1">sed(1)</span></code><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1648.1">, which cannot be done when messages are printed in a terminal window. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1648.2">However, writing to log files is not always the best approach, mainly because many services run as Docker images, which have their own log files that get lost when the Docker image stops.</span></p>
