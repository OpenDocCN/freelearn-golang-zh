    as it is also going to be the foundation for the rest of the book. The basics
    of Go, some design decisions, and the philosophy of Go are explained in this chapter
    so that you can get the big picture before learning the details of Go. Among other
    things, we present the advantages and disadvantages of Go so that you know when
    to use Go and when to consider other alternatives.

    we explain how to write information in log files, as this can help you store error
    messages and warnings while you are developing software in Go.

    and a type system that tries to save you from easy mistakes, such as implicit
    type conversions, unused variables, and unused packages. The Go compiler catches
    most of these easy mistakes and refuses to compile until you do something about
    them. Additionally, the Go compiler can find difficult-to-catch mistakes such
    as race conditions.

- en: Go comes with some important advantages for developers, starting with the fact
    that it was designed and is currently maintained by real programmers. Go is also
    easy to learn, especially if you are already familiar with programming languages
    such as C, Python, or Java. On top of that, due to its simplified and elegant
    syntax, Go code is pleasant to the eye, which is great, especially when you are
    programming applications for a living and you have to look at code on a daily
    basis. Go code is also easy to read, which means that you can make changes to
    existing Go code easily, and offers support for Unicode out of the box. Lastly,
    Go has reserved only 25 keywords, which makes it much easier to remember the language.
    Can you do that with C++?

- en: Go also comes with concurrency capabilities, using a simple concurrency model
    that is implemented using *goroutines* and *channels*. Go manages OS threads for
    you and has a powerful runtime that allows you to spawn lightweight units of work
    (goroutines) that communicate with each other using channels.

- en: Although Go comes with a rich standard library, there are really handy Go packages,
    such as `cobra` and `viper`, that allow Go to develop complex command line utilities
    such as `docker` and `hugo`. This is greatly supported by the fact that executable
    binaries are statically linked, which means that once they are generated, they
    do not depend on any shared libraries and include all required information. In
    practice, this means that you can transfer an existing executable file to a different
    machine with the same architecture and be sure that it is going to run without
    any issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    effects, and although Go supports pointers, it does not support pointer arithmetic
    like C, unless you use the `unsafe` package, which can be the root of many bugs
    and security holes. Although Go is not an object-oriented programming language,
    Go interfaces are very versatile and allow you to mimic some of the capabilities
    of object-oriented languages, such as polymorphism, encapsulation, and composition.
    However, Go offers no support for classes and inheritance. *Chapter 5*, *Reflection
    and Interfaces*, provides more information on the subject.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Go provides multiple ways to declare new variables to make the variable declaration
    process more natural and convenient. You can declare a new variable using the
    `var` keyword, followed by the variable name, followed by the desired data type
    (we are going to cover data types in detail in *Chapter 2*, *Basic Go Data Types*).
    If you want, you can follow that declaration with `=` and an initial value for
    your variable. If there is an initial value given, you can omit the data type
    and the compiler will infer it for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**This brings us to a very important Go rule: if no initial value is given
    to a variable, the Go compiler will automatically initialize that variable to
    the zero value of its data type.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is also the `:=` notation, which can be used instead of a var declaration.
    `:=` defines a new variable by inferring the data of the value that follows it.
    The official name for `:=` is *short assignment statement*, and it is very frequently
    used in Go, especially for getting the return values from functions and `for`
    loops with the `range` keyword.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The short assignment statement can be used in place of a `var` declaration with
    an implicit type. You rarely see the use of `var` in Go; the `var` keyword is
    mostly used for declaring global or local variables without an initial value.
    The reason for the former is that every statement that exists outside of the code
    of a function must begin with a keyword, such as `func` or `var`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that the short assignment statement cannot be used outside of a function
    environment because it is not permitted there. Last, you might need to use `var`
    when you want to be explicit about the data type. For example, when you want the
    type of a variable to be `int8` or `int32` instead of `int`, which is the default.

- en: Programs tend to display information, which means that they need to print data
    or send it somewhere for other software to store or process it. To print data
    on the screen, Go uses the functionality of the `fmt` package. If you want Go
    to take care of the printing, then you might want to use the `fmt.Println()` function.
    However, there are times when you want to have full control over how data is going
    to be printed. In such cases, you might want to use `fmt.Printf()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`fmt.Printf()` is similar to the C `printf()` function and requires the use
    of control sequences that specify the data type of the variable that is going
    to be printed. Additionally, the `fmt.Printf()` function allows you to format
    the generated output, which is particularly convenient for floating point values
    because it allows you to specify the digits that will be displayed in the output
    (`%.2f` displays two digits after the decimal point of a floating point value).
    Lastly, the `\n` character is used for printing a newline character and, therefore,
    creating a new line, as `fmt.Printf()` does not automatically insert a newline—this
    is not the case with `fmt.Println()`, which automatically inserts a newline, hence
    the `ln` at the end of its name.'

    based on the value of a variable or some other condition? Go supports the `if/else`
    and `switch` control structures. Both control structures can be found in most
    modern programming languages, so if you have already programmed in another programming
    language, you should already be familiar with both `if` and `switch` statements.
    `if` statements use no parenthesis to embed the conditions that need to be examined
    because Go does not use parentheses in general. As expected, `if` has support
    for `else` and `else if` statements.

    between various kinds of user input. For this technique to work, you should go
    from more specific cases to more generic ones. If we are talking about numeric
    values, you should first examine whether a string is a valid integer before examining
    whether the same string is a floating-point value, because every valid integer
    is also a valid floating-point value.

    model is implemented using *goroutines* and *channels*. A goroutine is the smallest
    executable Go entity. To create a new goroutine, you have to use the `go` keyword
    followed by a predefined function or an anonymous function—both these methods
    are equivalent as far as Go is concerned.

    communicate and exchange data. If you are an amateur programmer or are hearing
    about goroutines and channels for the first time, do not panic. Goroutines and
    channels, as well as pipelines and sharing data among goroutines, will be explained
    in much more detail in *Chapter 8*, *Go Concurrency*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although it is easy to create goroutines, there are other difficulties when
    dealing with concurrent programming, including goroutine synchronization and sharing
    data between goroutines—this is a Go mechanism for avoiding side effects by using
    global state when running goroutines. As `main()` runs as a goroutine as well,
    you do not want `main()` to finish before the other goroutines of the program
    because once `main()` exits, the entire program along with any goroutines that
    have not finished yet will terminate. Although goroutines cannot communicate directly
    with each other, they can share memory. The good thing is that there are various
    techniques for the `main()` function to wait for goroutines to exchange data through
    channels or, less frequently in Go, use shared memory.

    of goroutines, just like the OS scheduler is responsible for the execution of
    the OS threads. *Chapter 8*, *Go Concurrency*, discusses Go concurrency in more
    detail and presents the solution to that randomness issue with the use of a `sync.WaitGroup`
    variable—however, keep in mind that Go concurrency is everywhere, which is the
    main reason for including this section here. Therefore, as some error messages
    generated by the compiler discuss goroutines, you should not think that these
    goroutines were created by you.

    variable, splitting it, and iterating over the directories of the `PATH` variable.
    The third part is about looking for the desired binary file in these directories
    and determining whether it can be found or not, whether it is a regular file,
    and whether it is an executable file. If the desired executable file is found,

    comes from running servers and programs. Usually, most system log files of a UNIX
    system can be found under the `/var/log` directory. However, the log files of
    many popular services, such as Apache and Nginx, can be found elsewhere, depending

    Loki.
  prefs: []

    a better practice than writing the same output on screen for two reasons. Firstly,
    because the output does not get lost, as it is stored on a file, and secondly,
    because you can search and process log files using UNIX tools, such as `grep(1)`,
    `awk(1)`, and `sed(1)`, which cannot be done when messages are printed in a terminal
    window. However, writing to log files is not always the best approach, mainly
    because many services run as Docker images, which have their own log files that
    get lost when the Docker image stops.

    we are encouraged to simply log to `stderr` and let the container system redirect
    the `stderr` stream to the desired destination.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The UNIX logging service has support for two properties named *logging level*
    and *logging facility*. The logging level is a value that specifies the severity
    of the log entry. There are various logging levels, including `debug`, `info`,
    `notice`, `warning`, `err`, `crit`, `alert`, and `emerg`, in reverse order of
    severity. The `log` package of the standard Go library does not support working
    with logging levels. The logging facility is like a category used for logging
    information. The value of the logging facility part can be one of `auth`, `authpriv`,
    `cron`, `daemon`, `kern`, `lpr`, `mail`, `mark`, `news`, `syslog`, `user`, `UUCP`,
    `local0`, `local1`, `local2`, `local3`, `local4`, `local5`, `local6`, or `local7`
    and is defined inside `/etc/syslog.conf`, `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, or another appropriate
    file depending on the server process used for system logging on your UNIX machine.
    This means that if a logging facility is not defined correctly, it will not be
    handled; therefore, the log messages you send to it might get ignored and, therefore,
    lost.

    use of `log.SetOutput()` modifies that behavior. The list of functions for sending

    computed without processing all values first. After that, we process each valid
    value to compute the *standard deviation* because the mean value is required in
    order to compute the standard deviation.

    philosophy, and history of Go. Then, the basics of Go were presented, which include
    variables, iterations, and flow control as well as how to log data.

    means failure. Try to modify `which.go` to do so with the help of `os.Exit()`.

    the desired executable. Make the necessary code changes to `which.go` in order
    to find all possible occurrences of the desired executable.
