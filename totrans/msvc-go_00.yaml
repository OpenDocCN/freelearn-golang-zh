- en: Since its first release, the Go programming language has gained popularity among
    all types of software developers. Simple language syntax, ease of use, and a rich
    set of libraries made Go one of the primary languages for writing different kinds
    of software, from small tools to large-scale systems consisting of hundreds of
    components.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Among the primary Go use cases is microservice development – the development
    of individual applications, called microservices, that can play various roles,
    from processing payments to storing user data. Organizing a large system as a
    set of microservices often brings multiple advantages, such as increasing the
    development and deployment speed, but also brings multiple types of challenges.
    Among such challenges are service discovery and communication, integration testing,
    and service monitoring.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we will illustrate how to implement Go microservices and establish
    communication between them, how to enable the deployment of individual microservices
    and secure their interactions, and how to store and retrieve service data and
    provide service APIs, enabling other applications to use our microservices. You
    will learn about some of the industry’s best practices related to all of these
    topics and get a detailed overview of the possible challenges along the way, as
    well as the possible benefits. The knowledge that you will gain by reading this
    book will help you to both create new microservices and efficiently maintain the
    existing ones. I hope this journey will be exciting for you!

    how to write microservices in Go to seasoned professionals who want to take the
    next step in mastering the art of writing scalable and reliable microservice-based
    systems. The first two parts of the book, covering the development of microservices,
    would be useful to developers who are just starting their experience with Go or
    those who are interested in the best practices of organizing the Go application
    code base according to the industry’s best standards; the final part would be
    useful for all developers, even the most experienced ones, as it provides great
    insights on maintaining and operating microservices at scale.'

    will introduce the you to the main principles of the Go programming language and
    provide the most important recommendations for writing Go code. It will cover
    the process of setting up the right structure to organize the microservice code
    in Go and introduce the you to an example application consisting of three microservices.
    Finally, the chapter will illustrate how to scaffold the code for each of the
