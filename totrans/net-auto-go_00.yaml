- en: This book explores network automation, a discipline that aims to generate consistent
    and repeatable processes to increase efficiency and reliability in network operations.
    As you progress through the chapters, you’ll learn the Go language basics and
    put it into practice by coding common day-to-day network processes to jumpstart
    your network automation journey.
