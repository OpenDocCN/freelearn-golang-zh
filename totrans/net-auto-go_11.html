<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">We reached out to several people who have real-world hands-on experience with network automation and/or are using Go for network-related tasks and activities so that they could share their perspectives with us. </span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">We hope that their thoughts, lessons learned, ideas, and opinions will provide you with guidance and more food for thought about the role and importance of automation in the networking industry and reinforce the point that Go is not an esoteric, niche language, but one that is used extensively today for a wide range of network-related </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">use cases.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Traditionally, the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker980"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1"> networking space has been very stable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Most innovations came through standard bodies that took years to be ratified. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">In addition, vendors </span><a id="_idIndexMarker981"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">promoted certifications with clear and structured learning guides and courses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">This meant that network engineers had a clear path to start their careers and become certified experts without having to worry too much about being sidetracked and even without having to bother to figure out what came next for them; someone else had already </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">decided that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">However, the year is 2022 and our everyday vocabulary has gone from acronyms such as MPLS-over-GRE-over-IPSec to others such as IaC, CI, PR, and DevSecOps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">Our vendor-driven, slow-changing, cozy life is no more and now we need to keep up with the latest industry buzzwords</span><a id="_idIndexMarker982"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1"> and the breaking changes in the latest update of our framework/library of choice (luckily, we don’t need to keep up with JavaScript frameworks, for now). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">But do not despair—take the red pill and be ready to choose your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">own path.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">My advice </span><a id="_idIndexMarker983"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">to keep up with this ever-changing crazy world is as follows: rely less on vendor-driven certifications unless they are a hard requirement for your job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.2">Instead, grab books such as the one you are reading now. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.3">Get familiar with the ideas and concepts without worrying too much about the tiny details. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.4">Instead of setting up impossible lab scenarios, collaborate with open source projects and learn from the community, the tooling used to develop and maintain the project, the processes, the frameworks, the ideas, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.5">Finally, do not get overwhelmed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.6">People will come up with new buzzwords, libraries, projects, and so on all the time, but if you focus on the ideas, you quickly notice that things are not as earth-shattering as they claim to be and the industry doesn’t move as fast </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">as advertised.</span></span></p>

<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">1 – Automation will not replace network engineers</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Make </span><a id="_idIndexMarker990"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">no</span><a id="_idIndexMarker991"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1"> mistake, the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker992"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1"> discipline of network engineering is not going anywhere. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">How we interact with devices is amid revolution to be sure, but the knowledge of how a TCP three-way handshake takes place or how a routing protocol works is, and will continue to be, essential. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">In fact, the depth of this knowledge will likely increase as scripting networking workflows will require an in-depth understanding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.4">I never truly understood Cisco’s </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Application Centric Infrastructure</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">ACI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">) until</span><a id="_idIndexMarker993"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> I scripted a complete data center ACI </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">fabric build-out.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">2 – The power of text and revision control</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">This does </span><a id="_idIndexMarker994"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">not get said often enough (or ever), but text is all-powerful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">It is the lowest common denominator as well as the input to rich typesetting output with which to convey a written language (programming or otherwise). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">While putting together a richly formatted book or a computer script, you can take the simple text and snapshot its evolution over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.4">In this way, you know the exact nature of every change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.5">This is revision control. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.6">Originally developed to track code changes, today, as with network automation, you can put configurations, configuration templates, state, diagrams, documents, and almost anything under revision control. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.7">Before you leap into scripting, take a little bit of time to learn a revision control system such as Git </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">and GitHub.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">While we are on the topic of text, get a real text editor! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">Notepad and TextEdit are only handy if you have no other option (and learn </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">vi</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">—see </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">9 – Linux and regular expressions</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Invest the time to get familiar with more advanced text editors such as Sublime </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">or Atom.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">3 – Just start</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Approaching something new and unfamiliar can be daunting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">Just start. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.3">If you are new to programming, search for resources on basic programming concepts or programming fundamentals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.4">This is an important step if you are </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">NOT</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1"> familiar with the concepts of variables, scopes, operators, control structures, and namespaces. </span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Once you have a footing in these concepts, write down a particular problem you want to solve, pick a language, and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">dive right in</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">For me, it was generating configurations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">In fact, for every new programming language I learn, that is the first problem I solve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.4">I’m just working with text and not actual devices, so I can’t get into too much trouble. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.5">If there is a small problem at work that you are comfortable tackling, start there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.6">Define the problem clearly, detail the desired outcome, and just start. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.7">Jot down the specific steps and tackle each </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">one individually.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Let’s say you want to generate configuration commands for configuring the same VLAN on 10 devices and, just to keep it simple, output the necessary commands you need to run on each device to the screen. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">Your first script could be as simple as taking a list of devices and printing out to the screen the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">following configuration:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Once you </span><a id="_idIndexMarker995"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">have that, you will want to save the output to a text file. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">After that, you will want a file for each switch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">After that, you will start to customize each switch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">You get the idea. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">Every enhancement will teach you something new. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.6">Every new feature will expand </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">your experience.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">I </span><a id="_idIndexMarker998"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">initially </span><a id="_idIndexMarker999"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">started my career as a Java developer, with a massive passion for networking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">At first, it felt very weird to build systems automating networks without really understanding them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">But throughout the years, I learned to be sufficiently proficient in networking to properly build automation platforms around it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.4">Such knowledge can be acquired either by building labs, following workshops, or, for the luckiest ones, spending some time in a network </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">operation center.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">Something </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">that struck me the most, and is still true, is how much the path to network automation can be different if you come from a software developer versus a network engineering background. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">Both have their own acronyms, processes, standards, and so on, and yet, with the rise of cloud-native, Infra as Code, Network as Code, GitOps, and so on, we saw both worlds adopting similar concepts, methodologies, and tooling to do the initial provisioning and operate the entire life cycle of what was automated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.3">So, at a high level, the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">how</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1"> to perform the automation became fairly common, whereas the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">what</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1"> still remains fairly domain-specific. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.2">When embarking on such a journey, we should really take advantage of this ecosystem to accelerate our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">automation strategies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">In my </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">opinion, the basis of network automation is the configuration to apply a (golden) template of that configuration with well-defined (typed) parameters, and the protocol used to apply that configuration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">Another very important element required for service assurance is the notion of telemetry, to retrieve the running state and get updates on state changes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">and state.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">With my developer hat on, what matters most is the API/contract exposed by the network equipment/network function; these are commonly represented by the device YANG models. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">The main issue is, given the network is non-homogeneous, each vendor has its own models, and exposes more or less its functionalities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.3">Even though there is a lot of effort being put into standardizing the configuration and monitoring of network equipment (OpenConfig, OpenROADM, and IETF), this is certainly not fully adopted, and thus still requires a lot of </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">cookie-cutter</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1"> handling.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">Network automation strategies must account for this and accordingly design their platform to accept any type of network automation techniques. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">Of course, the more the said platform attempts to abstract that non-homogeneous environment, the more maintenance there is, as the shim layer that will convert from the device’s native API to that higher-level business API will have to keep up with the pace of device upgrade and device </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">model change.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">This put forward the following design decision: should you strive to have one abstraction layer for your entire network and maintain a shim layer that talks southbound </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">to devices?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">If yes, you’d better be armed with a team of developers to build and maintain </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">that abstraction.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">If </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">not, I suggest solving the issue by letting the network engineers build that golden template for each network service and have a platform to load, version, and interact with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">And that interaction might be a shell script, a Python snippet, a Go program, an Ansible playbook, and so on: whatever might work for that specific team, as long as the said platform exposes a REST API with the ability to execute it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.3">That way, network teams are empowered to automate by exposing the API and can stop worrying about the platform. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.4">The onus of keeping these golden templates and scriptlets </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">becomes theirs.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">Another </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">important aspect is having an orchestration engine enabling the definition of a workflow consuming these domain-specific APIs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">With maturity and governance, enforcing pre-check and post-check tasks should become a must-have in these workflows. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">Also, always consider how to roll back if the post-check isn’t successful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.4">Applying and rolling back configuration can be tricky when doing network-wide transactions; consider building helper functions to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">increase reusability.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">These orchestration engines can either be distributed or centralized, but often there will be an end-to-end service orchestration that will consume these exposed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">domain-specific workflows.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">Finally, one of the key components to keep in mind is the inventory of the network elements/functions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">As soon as a workflow does something, it is important to have and keep the inventory up to date so that service assurance workflows can properly act upon the active and available state of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">the network.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">Given most of the network automation is currently done either through NETCONF or gNxI southbound protocols, YANG has become the de facto model standard to define and express device configuration, and the tooling around YANG is mature enough to rely on XML/JSON for the golden templates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">Rendering these templates is also something easily doable, regardless of the technology used, even if enforcing YANG-defined types. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.3">Considering all of this, when starting a network automation journey, I wouldn’t advocate for a specific programming/scripting language, but rather let each team manage that for themselves. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.4">But I would definitely advocate for standardizing as much as possible the southbound protocol and interaction. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.5">As the journey matures, and you feel that, as an organization, you have a better handle on a specific technology, then you can build more helpers and start putting forward some company-wide practice </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">for automation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">As the network automation domain evolves, infrastructure provisioning is also evolving. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">With the rise of Kubernetes, the latest trend is to extend the Kubernetes API to provide </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">Custom Resource Definition</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">CRD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">) abstracting </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">hardware and software configuration, and supporting their entire lifecycle through the use of an </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">Operator. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.2">An Operator exposes the CRD as a K8S native API and contains the logic for managing the end-to-end lifecycle of a CRD instance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.3">This is shifting the responsibility of operation to the Operator </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">provider and is fostering intent-driven automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">As network equipment vendors adopt this concept, network automation will become even closer to application lifecycle management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">And with this trend, one of the main programming languages being put forward </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">is Go.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">So, what do I mean by centralized workflow enforcement? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">You want an RPC service that exists and has a set of actions that the service can do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.3">Your tools submit an RPC describing the set of actions and monitor the running of that from the server. </span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">This means all executions are running out of the same place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">You can then build emergency tools to stop problem network executions in case there are issues (or simply pause them). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.3">You can enforce concurrency limits on how many network devices can be touched within a time period. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.4">You can provide network health checks that have to run before an automation </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">can run.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">Before delving into Go, I used Python for all things network automation; no big surprises here. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.2">For the past couple of decades, the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">usual</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1"> network automation workflow revolved around crafting/templating CLI commands, sending them over SSH/Telnet to the network element’s CLI process, parsing the replies, and processing them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.2">Back then, you were lucky to have any kind of vendor-provided REST API. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.3">Hence, most automation projects were using screen scraping libraries with all the pains of dealing with unstructured data in an ad hoc way. </span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">My journey toward a decade of Go</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">Go is a great language, and for many, it’s a primary programming language as well as a tooling language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">Go provides a “belts and braces approach” in which even the compiler nags you to do the right thing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.3">Sure, you could write sloppy code, but the whole Go ecosystem is wired to help you not do that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.4">Most of the IDEs on the market have great Go tooling and will further lint and format your code, kicking you into being a better developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.5">Mat Ryer of Grafana Labs and the “Go Time” podcast once said: "</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">Because of the Go tools, I can read other people’s code and it feels familiar as if I’d written it."</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1"> That’s down to how the Go community has baked best practices into the toolchain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">You get that for free. </span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">For </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">amusement, but</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1"> also to make a point, I’m going to share a moment from my past career. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.2">I wrote C back in the day (C99) and wrote it on Microsoft Windows Notepad, linked it, and compiled it with individual tools into a binary, which then needed burning onto EPROMs for an embedded system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.3">I managed thousands of lines of plain text, without so much as a hint of what was going to work at the time of writing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.4">Test rigs helped, but the real world is always the truth. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.5">One day, I was called to an industrial unit where one of my systems had blown the lid off a water reservoir tank. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.6">In the moment and under pressure, I managed to find a bug because I’d written down the algorithm and left key comments in the code so I could follow under stress. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.7">Great tools and a solid engineering approach to writing code will save you from being fired or, even worse, being sued. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.8">If it was all spaghetti code (some of it was—I’m no hero), I’d have probably been imprisoned. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.9">Since then, we have great IDEs at our fingertips, and Go takes the best bits of C (in my opinion) and gives you a development journey that I’ve not found anywhere else. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.10">Ahead of even risking a production run, the compiler can tell me about race conditions, pointer problems, and a whole raft of things that I’ve been waiting </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">decades for.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">Beyond the IDE, compiler, and Go toolchain, Go lends itself to writing clear, readable, and maintainable code because of things such as error handling and desirable repetition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.2">Avoiding magic is a key tenet, and you should be able to import a package and initiate it deterministically in your own code because of the discipline within the Go community. </span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">Go offers so many out-of-the-box features, newcomers tend to get Go punch drunk. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.2">It’s normal to see goroutines appearing everywhere and channels being used in situations where they’re just not needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.3">Bill Kennedy of Ardan Labs has some great material on this, and if you think you need a goroutine, the chances are you probably do not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.4">It’s worth profiling your code with </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">pprof</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1"> before building things that you don’t need and doing some benchmarks through Go’s testing capabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">Go in its simplest form will probably outperform your use case, and deciding to keep your design architecturally simple in the early days will prevent complex headaches in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">the future.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-268"><a id="_idTextAnchor267"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.1">Background</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.644.1">I have had a very long winding path to come to where I </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.645.1">am today.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.1">I started my network automation </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.647.1">scripting</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.1"> back in TCL/Expect and Perl. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.2">Both of these ecosystems allowed for at least consistent repeated operations; however, everything else was a mess. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.3">Python added a robust ecosystem around libraries and version systems to allow for a more hermetic and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.1">repeatable world.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.1">The Python code base, though, suffered from a couple of issues, which made it hard to maintain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.2">The testing of the code itself was fairly straightforward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.3">However, because of a lack of typing, we often had to write a lot of type validation into the code and could only find these errors during runtime. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.4">Also, the general focus on using mocking to drive up coverage numbers but not extensively testing the public contracts caused fairly brittle tests, which slowed development in the long term. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.5">I don’t blame Python specifically for this, but it is very easy to fall into a pattern without the right tooling to enforce </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.1">good practices.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.1">I was introduced to Go around 2014 on a project and was quickly impressed with its strong typing, built-in tooling, and compilation speed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.2">Before this, I had been working on a C++ test framework for a project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.3">I was constantly frustrated with the complexity of building </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.1">flexible</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.1"> C++ code; it had become a meta-programming nightmare of templates to generically support all of our use cases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.2">Go fixed most of this by providing interface definitions for our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.1">use cases.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.1">Since then, I </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1042"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.1">have written three Go-based test frameworks for </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1043"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.1">different organizations, all with different system needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.2">The first framework represented some unique challenges for solution testing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.3">It required the ability to be open sourced. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.4">It needed to control components written by four different teams developing code in three different languages across two different build ecosystems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.5">The tests themselves had to run on both Linux and Windows test runners. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.6">Go allowed us to develop this ecosystem using just standard Go tools </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.1">for compilation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1">The next framework was used for solution testing of a cloud-based Kubernetes ecosystem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.2">We were able to make quick progress given the tooling and library support for k8s based projects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.3">We could leverage infrastructure for cluster bring-up, k8s deployment, operator deployment, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1">application lifecycle.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.1">The current framework I am involved with is Ondatra (see the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.1">Further reading</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.1"> section). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.2">This framework is focused on delivering an open source functional-, integration-, and solution-testing framework for network solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.3">It is currently used by internal teams in my organization through feature profiles (see the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.1">Further reading</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.1"> section) for describing our network device requirements </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.1">to vendors.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-269"><a id="_idTextAnchor268"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.1">Ability to impact the industry</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.669.1">One last point I would like to make is the ability of individuals to change </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.1">the industry.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.1">This industry has long been dominated by vendors and the perception that the IETF will solve your problems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.2">When it comes to automation, vendors are disincentivized to help. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.3">Every vendor-specific knob and API that can be created locks an operator further into a vendor solution that translates</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1044"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.1"> into </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.673.1">purchase orders</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.1">POs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.1">) </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.1">for them.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.1">By starting to shape this industry around software automation and APIs, we are moving a network from an art to computer science. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.2">We are on the path to where network devices are nothing more than general-purpose compute with fancy network interface cards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.3">With general APIs that can express intent, such as OpenConfig over gNMI, operators can build a single configuration and telemetry system that can support any number of vendors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.4">With additional operational APIs around bootstrapping, security, software, and file management, operators can uniformly build their infrastructure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.5">This becomes a very consistent testable layer that then can be used to test northbound services and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1045"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.1">downstream devices separately at the unit test layer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.2">Building a strong layered test strategy gives you confidence and finds breakages much faster in your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.1">development cycle.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.1">Don’t wait for </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1046"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.1">others to solve your needs; it won’t happen. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.2">If you want something, demand it from the vendors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.3">If they don’t do it, demand it from a standards body. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.4">If they don’t do it, take it upon yourself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.5">Don’t assume your idea is a bad one or that others have more understanding of the ecosystem than you do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.6">Get into the open source world and pitch your ideas. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.7">The model of software development and collaboration has drastically changed over the last 20 years, let alone just in the last 5 years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.8">Network automation has many opportunities to develop ecosystems that can have a minimal number of transforms between operator intent and state on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.1">network devices.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.1">Whether it is homegrown networking software or third-party OSS such as the BIRD routing daemon, I have learned that we absolutely need to be able to roll forward or roll back changes with ease. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.2">I am also a huge proponent of actionable alerts and runbooks; from experience, noisy alerts that are not directly tied to specific actions should never be pageable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.3">I’ve also come to appreciate Go for what it offers when writing networking code; compared to languages such as C, it has been far easier to iterate code quickly and cross-compile applications for various platforms using Go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.4">Go also has a useful network standard library and a growing ecosystem of packages that ease the process of writing code all the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.1">way from layer 2 and packet sockets to layer 7 using HTTP. </span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.1">In summary, if I had to advise someone newly entering this field of networking and Go software</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.1"> engineering, I would say the following: </span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.1">For a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.1">good long while, I kind of felt like the network automation folks espousing Go were living in a fantasy land! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.2">Why would you need anything other than Python? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.3">Certainly, the speed/ease of development of Python outweighed the general speed of Go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.4">Surely the much larger network automation ecosystem in Python was such a leg up that Go could never compete! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.5">Perhaps, I thought, the Go network automation advocates only had the newest fanciest gear that had 100% support for everything they could need to do with RESTCONF or gRPC. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.6">They probably also drank only the finest artisan coffees and beers and had enviable mustaches and/or colorful, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.783.1">fancy hair!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.1">Naturally, these thoughts are all silly, and eventually, I started growing out a fancy mustache and learning Go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.2">Just kidding—I can’t grow a mustache, or at least not an enviable one, but I did dive </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.1">into Go!</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.1">Lean into the typing ecosystem in Python. </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.791.1">mypy</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.1"> is awesome—you will catch bugs you had no idea you had. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.2">You will learn a ton about typing, and the best part: if your typing is all broken, your programs will still run! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.3">Being a pretty rabid-type hinting fan, I feel it helped me a ton when going into Go where it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.793.1">is required.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.794.1">Take the time to really understand interfaces and how to use them idiomatically. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.794.2">At first, for me, they were just kind of clunky abstract base classes, but of course, they really are more than that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.794.3">While we’re at it, make sure to understand the empty interface and how to use and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.1">abuse that!</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.796.1">Stop trying to inherit all the things! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.796.2">This was (is?!) difficult for me—I quite fancied inheritance (perhaps too much, and perhaps that is a taboo nowadays anyway?), so it has been somewhat of a challenge at times to break away from that pattern. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.796.3">Sure, embed a struct here and there, but generally try to move away from that inheritance </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.797.1">style mentality.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.798.1">Let the robots (linters) yell at you and tell you how bad your code is! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.798.2">I like </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.1">golangci-lint</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.800.1">, which is a linter aggregator that runs tons of linters against your code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.800.2">Get a ton of errors, and search-engine-engineer your way to understanding why the error exists and how you can do better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.800.3">While annoying, I’ve learned a ton from all the errors I’ve created </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.801.1">this way!</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.802.1">I suspect</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.803.1"> Go will continue to become more and more commonplace in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.804.1">the network automation community. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.804.2">The benefits of language—speed, small footprint, compiled binary, and on and on—are hard to ignore. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.804.3">Moreover, as the network automation ecosystem continues to expand and grow, I believe that network automation roles will be increasingly software-centric, rather than network-centric or automation/software as an afterthought of a network role; as that happens, Go will be increasingly important for all the reasons espoused in this very book! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.804.4">Of course, just as Python is not the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.805.1">one ring to rule them all</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.806.1">, neither will Go be, but both are tools you should absolutely have in your toolbelt... </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.806.2">or some other worn-out platitude. </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.807.1">Happy Gophering!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.847.1">Coming</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.848.1"> from a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.849.1"> Linux administrator/systems engineering background, I’ve been used to having home-grown automation solutions in place to manage a fleet of—for me at the time—a large number of servers and clients since my first job at the IT center of the Institute of Mathematics at Paderborn University in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.850.1">early 2004.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.851.1">We had a locally developed software suite called SDeployment—written in Shell if I remember correctly—that was responsible for provisioning the correct software packages and desired configuration file state onto Linux-based servers and clients and enforcing the desired state to stay </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.852.1">this way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.1">This even helped to detect an intruder who managed to exchange the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.854.1">sshd</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.855.1"> binary, which didn’t have support for Kerberos, so he needed to change the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.856.1">sshd_config</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.857.1">, which got overwritten after 1 hour and the service didn’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.858.1">start anymore.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.859.1">At the time this was a huge benefit over solutions such as CFEngine, which could do incremental changes to configuration files but not maintain them holistically; Puppet had not been born yet (according </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.860.1">to Wikipedia).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.861.1">With the rise of Bcfg2, Puppet, Chef, Salt, and Ansible, we saw a shift from incremental configuration changes to intent-based configuration management in the wider industry, where the operator describes the desired state (intent) and writes templates to generate contents of entire configuration files, and the configuration management solution’s task is to make this a reality and keep it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.862.1">this way.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-276"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.863.1">Mental shift to holistic automation</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.864.1">The systems engineering/SRE world underwent this shift in thinking a long time ago, but it feels like </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.865.1">the majority of network automation solutions are still </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.866.1">following the idea of making incremental changes to the routers and switches out there, which, at the same time, might also be managed manually by operators typing (or copying) magic spells into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.867.1">a CLI.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.868.1">This makes the device configuration the synchronization point, and we don’t really have an idea of what this configuration will look like in full without checking back on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.869.1">the device.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.870.1">I believe we, as network (automation) engineers, need to follow suit, make the mental shift to the holistic approach, let Perl, Shell, and Expect scripts be, and bring software engineering methods to network automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.870.2">This way, we are able to tackle the problems at hand at an abstract level and build solutions that can be reasoned with, tested on their own, and that scale to our needs (see </span><a href="B16971_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor128"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.1">Chapter 5</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.872.1">, </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.1">Network Automation</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.874.1">).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.875.1">For the most daunting problem of configuration management, this means plugging some of those systems together and building a solution that generates and owns the full </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.876.1">device configuration.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.877.1">The automation will likely rely on multiple inputs to gain full knowledge of the topology, operational overrides, subscribers, and services, as well as rules to derive the configuration from all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.878.1">of that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.879.1">This is following the overarching goal to do as few configuration changes as possible and leverage protocols such as BGP and BMP to extract/observe state or manipulate device state where more dynamic changes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.880.1">are required.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-277"><a id="_idTextAnchor276"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.881.1">This is the way</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.882.1">Having all of this in the cards, the only API you need from a device is a function to upload a new complete configuration and let the device figure out the path from the current configuration to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.883.1">new one.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.884.1">Dealing with diverging configuration parts across the fleet, carefully cleaning up old approaches to configure X, doing incremental changes, and figuring out how to interact with a platform API, a dialect of NETCONF, YANG, and so on would all be from the past—wouldn’t that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.885.1">be great?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.886.1">I believe we have a bright future ahead </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.887.1">of us!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.890.1">With </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.891.1">Go, you have a very solid foundation to build reliable, scalable, and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.892.1">fairly easily testable and observable software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.892.2">Prometheus integration is at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.893.1">your fingertips.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.896.1">Existing open source suites such as Bio-Routing can help you on the first part (using BMP/RIS) and act as the foundation to, for example, build a route-injector following your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.897.1">business logic.</span></span></p>
