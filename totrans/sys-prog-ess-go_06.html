			<p>Pipes are <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>fundamental tools in <strong class="bold">inter-process communication</strong> (<strong class="bold">IPC</strong>), allowing for efficient data <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>transfer between system processes. This chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of pipes, their functionality, and their application in various programming scenarios, particularly focusing on their use <span class="No-Break">in Go.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear understanding of how pipes function in IPC, their significance in system programming, and how to effectively implement them in Go. The chapter aims to equip readers with the knowledge to utilize pipes for efficient process communication in their <span class="No-Break">programming projects.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover these <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are pipes <span class="No-Break">in IPC?</span></li>
				<li>The mechanics of <span class="No-Break">anonymous pipes</span></li>
				<li>Navigating named <span class="No-Break">pipes (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Mkfifo()</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li>Best practices – guidelines for <span class="No-Break">using pipes</span></li>
				<li>Developing a log <span class="No-Break">processing tool</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>We will use some system dependencies to execute this chapter’s examples. So, make sure you have these <span class="No-Break">programs available:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">grep</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">echo</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>What are pipes in IPC?</h1>
			<p>In system programming, we <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>can envision a pipe as a conduit within memory designed for transporting data between two or more processes. This conduit adheres to the <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>producer-consumer model: one process, the producer, funnels data into the pipe, while another, the consumer, taps into this stream to read the data. As a pivotal element of IPC, pipes establish a unidirectional flow of information. This setup ensures that data consistently moves in one direction – from the “write end” to the “read end” of the pipe. This mechanism allows processes to communicate in a streamlined and efficient manner, much like water flowing through a pipe, with one process smoothly passing information down the line to <span class="No-Break">the next.</span></p>
			<p>Pipes are used in a variety of system-level programming tasks. The most common applications <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Command-line utilities</strong>: Pipes are often used to connect the output of one command-line utility to the input of another, enabling the creation of powerful <span class="No-Break">command chains</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data streaming</strong>: When data needs to be streamed from one process to another, pipes offer a simple and <span class="No-Break">effective solution</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inter-process data exchange</strong>: Pipes facilitate data exchange between processes, essential in many <span class="No-Break">multi-process applications</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Why are pipes important?</h2>
			<p>Pipes allow <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>modular software creation where different processes specialize in specific tasks and communicate efficiently. They facilitate efficient use of system resources by enabling direct communication between processes without needing intermediate storage. Also, they provide a simple yet powerful interface for data exchange, making complex operations <span class="No-Break">more manageable.</span></p>
			<p>Since pipes are designed to allow data to move in a single direction, two pipes are often used for two-way communication. They operate buffering data until another process reads the data. This mechanism is especially useful for handling cases where the reader and the writer operate at <span class="No-Break">different speeds.</span></p>
			<p>At this point, you should have been scratching your head and asking yourself <em class="italic">Are they Go’s channel-like structures?</em> And the answer is <em class="italic">Yes, in </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">some sort</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>There are similarities<a id="_idIndexMarker285"/> <span class="No-Break">between them:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Communication mechanisms</strong>: Both pipes and channels are primarily used for communication. Pipes <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>facilitate IPC, while channels are used for communication between goroutines within a <span class="No-Break">Go program.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data transfer</strong>: At a basic level, both pipes and channels transfer data. In pipes, data flows from one process to another, while data is passed between goroutines <span class="No-Break">in channels.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Synchronization</strong>: Both provide a level of synchronization. Writing to a full pipe or reading from an empty pipe will block the process until the pipe is read from or written to, respectively. Similarly, sending to a full channel or receiving from an empty channel in Go will block the goroutine until the channel is ready for <span class="No-Break">more data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Buffering</strong>: Pipes and channels can be buffered. A buffered pipe has a defined capacity before it blocks or overflows, and similarly, Go channels can be created with a capacity, allowing a certain number of values to be held without immediate <span class="No-Break">receiver readiness.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>But more <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>importantly, there <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/><span class="No-Break">are differences:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Direction of communication</strong>: Standard pipes are unidirectional, meaning they only allow data flow in one direction. Channels in Go are bidirectional by default, allowing data to be sent and received on the <span class="No-Break">same channel.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ease of use in context</strong>: Channels are a native feature of Go, offering integration and ease of use within Go programs that pipes cannot match. As a system-level feature, pipes require more setup and handling when used <span class="No-Break">in Go.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>So, before we create our first Go programs using pipes, keep the following guidelines <span class="No-Break">in mind.</span></p>
			<p>Use pipes in the <span class="No-Break">following scenarios:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>You must facilitate communication between different processes, possibly across different <span class="No-Break">programming languages</span></li>
				<li>Your application<a id="_idIndexMarker289"/> involves separate executables that need to communicate with <span class="No-Break">each other</span></li>
				<li>You work in a Unix-like environment and can leverage robust <span class="No-Break">IPC mechanisms</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Use Go channels when the <span class="No-Break">following applies:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>You are developing concurrent applications in Go and need to synchronize and communicate <span class="No-Break">between goroutines</span></li>
				<li>You require a straightforward and safe way to handle concurrency within a single <span class="No-Break">Go program</span></li>
				<li>You must implement complex concurrency patterns, such as fan-in, fan-out, or worker pools, which Go’s channel and goroutine model <span class="No-Break">elegantly handle</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In our<a id="_idIndexMarker290"/> development routine, we are used to using pipes every time on <span class="No-Break">the terminal.</span></p>
			<p>As mentioned before, pipes pass the output of one command as the input to another. Here’s a simple example <span class="No-Break">in </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">bash</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
cat file.txt | grep "flower"</pre>			<p>In this command, <strong class="source-inline">cat file.txt</strong> reads the content of <strong class="source-inline">file.txt</strong>, and then the pipe (<strong class="source-inline">|</strong>) passes this content as input to <strong class="source-inline">grep "flower"</strong>, which searches for lines <span class="No-Break">containing </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">"flower"</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>To replicate this whole sequence of steps in Go, we need to read the contents of a file and then process these contents to find the <span class="No-Break">desired string.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">We don’t need to use pipes to achieve the same result since Go doesn’t use Unix-like pipes similarly; we typically read and process the data using Go’s file handling and string <span class="No-Break">processing capabilities.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Pipes in Golang</h2>
			<p>Go’s standard<a id="_idIndexMarker291"/> library provides the necessary functions to create and <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>manage pipes. The <strong class="source-inline">io.Pipe()</strong> function is commonly used to create a synchronous, in-memory pipe. This function is relevant to keep in mind when you only need to achieve this flow of control over the data but not execute any <span class="No-Break">system call.</span></p>
			<p>Also, for using OS pipes, we can call the <strong class="source-inline">os.Pipe()</strong> function This function internally uses the <strong class="source-inline">SYS_PIPE2</strong> syscall, and the Go <strong class="source-inline">stdlib</strong> package handles all the complexity for us, returning a connected pair <span class="No-Break">of files.</span></p>
			<p>In both cases, data is written to the write end of the pipe using standard write operations and read from the read end using standard read operations. It’s crucial to ensure that any issues during data transfer, such as broken pipes or data integrity problems, are <span class="No-Break">effectively managed.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>The mechanics of anonymous pipes</h1>
			<p>Anonymous pipes<a id="_idIndexMarker293"/> are the most basic form of pipes. They are used for communication between parent and child processes. Let’s explore how we can replicate the simple<a id="_idIndexMarker294"/> <span class="No-Break">script beforementioned:</span></p>

			</ol>
			<p>This approach <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>using the <strong class="source-inline">Output()</strong> method is convenient. It works well in many scenarios, especially when dealing with straightforward command execution where you just need to capture the output of <span class="No-Break">a command.</span></p>
			<p>There are limitations to anonymous pipes since they are only useful for communication if the creating process or its descendants are alive. Also, we have a unidirectional data flow. To address these issues, we can use <span class="No-Break">named pipes.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Navigating named pipes (Mkfifo())</h1>
			<p>Named pipes are <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>not limited to live processes, unlike anonymous pipes. They can be used between any processes and persist in <span class="No-Break">the filesystem.</span></p>
			<p>IPC can <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>sometimes be an abstract concept, challenging to grasp for those new to system programming. Let’s use a simple, relatable analogy to make this easier: the “task mailbox” in an <span class="No-Break">office setting.</span></p>
			<p>Imagine you’re in an office where every team member has a specific set of tasks. Communication and task delegation are key to the smooth operation of this office. How do team members efficiently exchange tasks and information? This is where the idea of a “task mailbox” comes <span class="No-Break">into play.</span></p>
			<p>In our analogy, a task mailbox is a special mailbox in the office where team members drop off tasks for others. Once a task is in the mailbox, the designated team member can pick it up, process it, and move on to the next one. This system ensures that tasks are communicated and handled efficiently, without direct interaction between team members, every time a task needs to <span class="No-Break">be passed.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s translate<a id="_idIndexMarker303"/> this analogy into our program. Since processes often need to communicate with each other, just like team members in an office, this is where named pipes come into play. It acts like our task mailbox, serving as a conduit through which different processes can exchange information. One process can drop information into the pipe, and another can pick it up for processing. It’s a simple yet effective way to facilitate communication <span class="No-Break">between processes.</span></p>
			<p>To bring this analogy to life, let’s create this program. We’ll create a virtual “task mailbox” (a named pipe) and demonstrate how one can use it to pass messages (tasks) between different parts of a program. This example will illustrate the concept of named pipes and make the abstract idea of IPC more tangible and easier <span class="No-Break">to understand.</span></p>
			<p>First, let’s handle the creation of our named pipe. We need to verify whether the named <span class="No-Break">pipe exists:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
func namedPipeExists(pipePath string) bool {
   _, err := os.Stat(pipePath)
   if err == nil {
      return true // The named pipe exists.
   }
   if os.IsNotExist(err) {
      return false // The named pipe does not exist.
   }
   fmt.Println("Error checking named pipe:", err)
   return false
}</pre>			<p>In our <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function, we make sure we are creating a named pipe when it does not exist. The <strong class="source-inline">Mkfifo()</strong> function <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>creates a named pipe in <span class="No-Break">the filesystem:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
// Check if the mailbox exists
if !namedPipeExists(mailboxPath) {
   fmt.Println("The mailbox does not exist.")
   // Set up the mailbox (named pipe)
   fmt.Println("Creating the task mailbox...")
   if err := unix.Mkfifo(mailboxPath, 0666); err != nil {
      fmt.Println("Error setting up the task mailbox:", err)
      return
   }
}</pre>			<p>Once <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>created, <strong class="source-inline">os.OpenFile</strong> with <strong class="source-inline">os.O_RDWR</strong> is used to open the pipe for reading. This way, the data sent is read from <span class="No-Break">the pipe:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
// Open the named pipe for read and write
mailbox, err := os.OpenFile(mailboxPath, os.O_RDWR, os.ModeNamedPipe)
if err != nil {
   fmt.Println("Error opening named pipe:", err)
}
defer mailbox.Close()</pre>			<p>Now, our main logic resides in one goroutine sending tasks over the pipe while another reads them. Once we’re using a scanner, we stop reading for new tasks when the sender sends an <strong class="source-inline">"EOD"</strong> (end of day) string instance. To synchronize these goroutines, we’re <span class="No-Break">using </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">sync.WaitGroup</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
wg := &amp;sync.WaitGroup{}
wg.Add(2)
go func() {
   defer wg.Done()
   ReadTask(mailbox)
}()
go func() {
   defer wg.Done()
   i := 0
   for i &lt; 10 {
      SendTask(mailbox, fmt.Sprintf(«Task %d\n», i))
      i++
   }
   // Close the mailbox
   SendTask(mailbox, "EOD\n")
   fmt.Println("All tasks sent.")
}()
wg.Wait()</pre>			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> sending logic in the <strong class="source-inline">writer.go</strong> file is simply pushing data over <span class="No-Break">the pipe:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

   _, err := pipe.WriteString(data)
   if err != nil {

   return nil

			<p>Chunking <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>involves breaking down large datasets into smaller, more manageable pieces. The primary advantage of chunking is that it prevents the overfilling of pipe buffers, which can lead to bottlenecks in data transmission. By segmenting the data, each chunk can be processed and transmitted sequentially, ensuring a smoother and more efficient flow of data. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where data is streamed or processed in <span class="No-Break">real time.</span></p>
			<h3>Example – Chunking data</h3>
			<p>In this snippet, the <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>idea is the writer sends data by chunk size and the reader receives <span class="No-Break">the same.</span></p>
			<p>The code on the writer’s side looks <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
func writeInChunks(pipe *os.File, data []byte, chunkSize int) error {
   for i := 0; i &lt; len(data); i += chunkSize {
      end := i + chunkSize
      if end &gt; len(data) {
         end = len(data)
      }
      chunk := data[i:end]
      _, err := pipe.Write(data[i:end])
      if err != nil {
         return err
      }
      writer.Flush() // Ensure chunk is written
   }
   return nil
}</pre>			<p>And on the reader’s side, it <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>looks <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
// Read chunks from the named pipe
    for {
        chunk, err := reader.ReadBytes('\n') // Assuming chunks are newline-separated
        if err != nil {
            if err == io.EOF {
                break // End of file reached
            }
            panic(err)
        }
        fmt.Printf("Received chunk: %s\n", string(chunk))
    }</pre>			<p>Compression is the process of reducing the size of data before it is sent. This is especially beneficial when the data is highly compressible, such as text files or certain types of image and video files. By compressing data, the volume of information that needs to be transmitted is significantly reduced, leading to faster transmission times and potentially lower bandwidth usage. However, it’s important to consider the computational overhead of compressing and decompressing data, as well as the nature of the data itself (some data may not <span class="No-Break">compress well).</span></p>
			<h3>Example – Compressing data</h3>
			<p>For <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>compression, you can use a library such as <strong class="source-inline">compress/gzip</strong> to compress and <span class="No-Break">decompress data.</span></p>
			<p>In these snippets, the writer compresses the data while the reader decompresses it to <span class="No-Break">read it.</span></p>
			<p>In the following snippet, we’re compressing and sending <span class="No-Break">the data:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
   // Create a gzip writer on top of the named pipe
     gzipWriter := gzip.NewWriter(fifo)
  // Example data to compress and write
    data := []byte("Some data to be compressed and written to the pipe")
    // Write compressed data to the named pipe
    if _, err := gzipWriter.Write(data); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    gzipWriter.Flush() // Ensure data is written</pre>			<p>So, for reading, we’ll decompress the data, <span class="No-Break">as well:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
// Create a gzip reader
gzipReader, err := gzip.NewReader(fifo)
if err != nil {
   // handler errors
}
defer gzipReader.Close()
// Read and decompress data from the named pipe
var buf bytes.Buffer
io.Copy(&amp;buf, gzipReader)</pre>			<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Error handling and resource management</h2>
			<p>We must <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>handle <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>errors and properly save resources to<a id="_idIndexMarker319"/> create maintainable and robust software. Let’s explore how we can approach these two dimensions <span class="No-Break">of robustness.</span></p>
			<h3>Robust error handling</h3>
			<p>Always <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>check for errors after pipe operations. This includes read, write, and close operations. Also, implement timeouts for read/write operations to <span class="No-Break">avoid deadlocks.</span></p>
			<h4>Example – Reading pipes with timeout</h4>
			<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>this snippet, we have a boilerplate to read pipes leveraging <span class="No-Break">in-context timeouts:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
timeout := time.After(5 * time.Second)
done := make(chan bool)
go func() {
    _, err := pipe.Read(buffer)
    // Handle read operation and error
    done &lt;- true
}()
select {
case &lt;-timeout:
    // Handle timeout, e.g., close pipe, log error
case &lt;-done:
    // Read operation completed
}</pre>			<h3>Proper resource management</h3>
			<p>Ensure pipes<a id="_idIndexMarker322"/> are properly closed after use. Use <strong class="source-inline">defer</strong> for closing file descriptors <span class="No-Break">in Go.</span></p>
			<p>In the following snippet, we can observe that we can avoid <span class="No-Break">resource leakage:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
pipeReader, pipeWriter, _ := os.Pipe()
defer pipeReader.Close()
defer pipeWriter.Close()
// Perform pipe operations</pre>			<p class="callout-heading">Handling leaks</p>
			<p class="callout">Monitor for any resource leaks. Left open, pipes can lead to file <span class="No-Break">descriptor exhaustion.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>Security considerations</h2>
			<p>When we’re <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>transmitting sensitive data, we should consider encrypting it before sending it through a pipe. After receiving data through <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>pipes, we need to ensure the validation of this data, especially if used in critical parts of <span class="No-Break">our programs.</span></p>
			<p>We also need to be cautious with permissions when creating named pipes. Restrict access to trusted users. Also, use randomized or unpredictable names to prevent name squatting attacks for <span class="No-Break">named pipes.</span></p>
			<h4>Example – Securing named pipe creation</h4>
			<p>In the following<a id="_idIndexMarker325"/> snippet, the pipe name receives a random factor and restricts access to the <span class="No-Break">pipe owner:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
pipePath := "/tmp/my_secure_pipe_" + randomString(10)
syscall.Mkfifo(pipePath, 0600) // Restricts access to the owner only</pre>			<p class="callout-heading">Name squatting attack</p>
			<p class="callout">In a name squatting attack, an attacker creates a named pipe with a name that is expected to be used by a legitimate application or service. This attack typically targets applications or services that dynamically create named pipes for IPC but do not adequately verify the identity of the <span class="No-Break">pipe’s creator.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Performance optimization</h2>
			<p>Adjust buffer<a id="_idIndexMarker326"/> sizes by tuning them based on your application’s needs. Smaller buffers can reduce memory usage, while larger ones can <span class="No-Break">improve throughput.</span></p>
			<p>This next practice is crucial for achieving good performance: use non-blocking I/O operations to improve performance, especially in applications that require <span class="No-Break">high responsiveness.</span></p>
			<p>By following these best practices, you can ensure that your use of named pipes in Go is not only effective but also secure and maintainable. Named pipes are a powerful tool in system programming, and with careful consideration of these guidelines, you can harness their full potential to build robust and efficient applications. As you continue to develop your skills in Go and system programming, keep these practices in mind to enhance the quality of <span class="No-Break">your code.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>Developing a log processing tool</h1>
			<p>Having <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>covered the fundamentals of pipes in IPC and best practices for their use in Go, let’s explore more advanced topics. We will explore a scenario where pipes can be effectively utilized and see how Go’s concurrency model complements these use cases. This section aims to give you practical insights into leveraging pipes for sophisticated system <span class="No-Break">programming tasks.</span></p>
			<p>In the next example, we’ll develop a simple real-time log processing tool. This tool will read log data from a file (simulating a log file being written by another process), process the log entries (for example, filtering based on severity), and then output the results to <span class="No-Break">the console.</span></p>
			<p>First, we create a <strong class="source-inline">filterLogs()</strong> function that reads logs from the reader, filters them, and writes to <span class="No-Break">the writer:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
func filterLogs(reader io.Reader, writer io.Writer) {
   scanner := bufio.NewScanner(reader)
   for scanner.Scan() {
      logEntry := scanner.Text()
      if strings.Contains(logEntry, "ERROR") {
         writer.Write([]byte(logEntry + "\n"))
      }
   }
}</pre>			<p>Note that the <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>function reads from a reader (our named pipe), filters the log entries only to include those containing <strong class="source-inline">"ERROR"</strong>, and writes them to a writer (we’re sending to <span class="No-Break">standard output):</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
func main() {
   // Create a named pipe (simulating a log file)
   pipePath := "/tmp/my_log_pipe"
   if err := os.RemoveAll(pipePath); err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }
   if err := os.Mkfifo(pipePath, 0600); err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }
   defer os.RemoveAll(pipePath)
   // Open the named pipe for reading
   pipeFile, err := os.OpenFile(pipePath, os.O_RDONLY|os.O_CREATE, os.ModeNamedPipe)
   if err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }
   defer pipeFile.Close()
   // Start a goroutine to simulate log writing
   go func() {
      writer, err := os.OpenFile(pipePath, os.O_WRONLY, os.ModeNamedPipe)
      if err != nil {
         panic(err)
      }
      defer writer.Close()
      for {
         writer.WriteString("INFO: All systems operational\n")
         writer.WriteString("ERROR: An error occurred\n")
         time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
      }
   }()
   // Process the logs
   filterLogs(pipeFile, os.Stdout)
}</pre>			<p>In the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function, a <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>named pipe is created to simulate a log file. This pipe acts as the source of log data. The pipe is opened for reading. Concurrently, a goroutine is started to simulate writing log entries to this pipe, including both <strong class="source-inline">"INFO"</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">"ERROR"</strong> messages. The <strong class="source-inline">filterLogs()</strong> function is called to process incoming log data. It filters and outputs <span class="No-Break">error messages.</span></p>
			<p>Although simple, this code demonstrates a practical application of pipes in Go for real-time log processing. It shows how to set up a pipeline for continuous data processing, simulating a common scenario in system monitoring and log <span class="No-Break">analysis tools.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>As we conclude this chapter, let’s reflect on the key insights and knowledge we’ve gained about IPC in system programming, especially in the context <span class="No-Break">of Go.</span></p>
			<p>We explored their fundamental role in facilitating data exchange between processes, emphasizing their importance in system-level programming.
