- en: At the beginning of my career as a software engineer, I was focused on understanding
    technical concepts and delivering functionality as fast as I could. As I advanced
    in my career and matured my code-writing craft, I started to understand the importance
    of code quality and maintainability. This is especially important for Go developers
    since the language is designed around the values of efficiency, simplicity, and
    safety.

- en: This book aims to provide you with all the tools you need to elevate the quality
    of your own Go code, through the industry-standard development methodology of
    **Test-Driven Development** (**TDD**). It provides a comprehensive introduction
    to the principles and practices of TDD, helping you get started without any prior
    knowledge. It also demonstrates how to apply this methodology to Go, which continues
    to gain popularity as a development language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout this book, we will explore how to leverage the benefits of TDD demonstrated
    with a variety of code examples, including building a demo REST API. This practical
    approach will teach you how to design testable code and write efficient Go tests,
    using the standard testing library as well as popular open source third-party
    libraries in the Go development ecosystem.

- en: This book introduces the practices of TDD and teaches you how to use them in
    the development of Go applications using practical examples. It demonstrates how
    to leverage the benefits of TDD in applications at every level, ensuring that
    they deliver functional and non-functional requirements. It also touches on important
    principles of how to design and implement testable code, such as containerization,
    database integrations, and microservice architectures.

    engineer. In its pages, I have included all the knowledge that I wish I had when
    I first started out with Go development, which I hope will help make writing well-tested
    code easier for you.

    supplement Go’s standard `testing` library. Finally, we learn how to implement
    and leverage the popular technique of table-driven testing to easily write tests
    that cover a variety of scenarios, making it easy to cover multiple test scenarios
    and extend the scope of our tests. In this section, we also begin the implementation
    of our demo REST API, the `BookSwap` web application.
